Spam. It‚Äôs the annoying junk mail of the digital world. You set up a simple contact form, expecting genuine inquiries or leads, but instead, you get flooded with messages in languages you don‚Äôt understand, bot-generated junk, and emails from sketchy domains. Sound familiar?

Many businesses struggle with spam form submissions, especially when they receive entries in unwanted languages or from disposable emails used by bots.¬†

You can automate spam blocking in Zapier based on language‚Äîand even filter out bad emails, IPs, and harmful content‚Äîusing Translate by Zapier and the OOPSpam Zapier app.

In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through two powerful ways to automatically stop spam submissions in Zapier and ensure only legitimate messages reach your inbox.

## **Why Spam Filtering Based on Language Matters**

![OOPSpam Anti-Spam featuring the tagline "Automate your Spam and Abuse Detection" with logos of Webflow, bettermode, and readme, indicating companies that use the service.](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-overview.png "OOPSpam Anti-Spam - Automate Spam and Abuse Detection")

Before we dive into the setup, let‚Äôs talk about why language-based spam filtering is crucial:

* **You only need leads in one or two languages.** If your business operates in English, there‚Äôs no reason to get messages in Russian, Chinese, or Spanish unless you target those markets.
* **Spam bots often use non-English messages.** Many spam submissions include random text in different languages, which can be an easy way to filter them out.
* **Better data quality and efficiency.** Filtering out unwanted languages means you don‚Äôt waste time manually reviewing irrelevant submissions.

> For even stronger protection, you can block spam at the source by using OOPSpam‚Äôs anti-spam plugin on your website. Our [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) is a great option for stopping spam before it even enters your workflow. We also offer [integrations](https://www.oopspam.com/integrations/) on other platforms. If you don‚Äôt see an integration for your system, you can always use the [OOPSpam API](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#using-the-api-via-dashboard) to add spam filtering to your custom setup.¬†

## **Filtering Spam Form Submissions with Translate by Zapier**

Zapier offers a built-in tool called [Translate by Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/translate/integrations) that can detect the language of a form submission. By combining it with a Zapier Filter, you can block unwanted languages before they even hit your inbox.

### **How to Set Up Language-Based Spam Filtering in Zapier**

![Translate by Zapier Integrations banner.](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-translate-integration.png "Zapier Translate Integration")

Here‚Äôs how to use Translate by Zapier to automatically block form submissions in unwanted languages:

### **Step 1: Set Up the Trigger**

Before we can filter out form spam by language, we first need to set up the trigger so that Zapier knows when to act.

1. Open Zapier and **create a new Zap**.
2. Select your **form application** as the trigger (Google Forms, Typeform, Gravity Forms, etc.).
3. Choose the event: **‚ÄúNew Form Submission‚Äù**
4. Connect your form app and test the trigger to ensure Zapier pulls in recent submissions.

### **Step 2: Use Translate by Zapier to Detect Language**

Once the trigger is set up, we‚Äôll use Translate by Zapier to analyze the submitted text and determine its language. This is a crucial step since Zapier will use the detected language as a filter condition.

![Zapier Translate integration setup for detecting language.](/blog/assets/posts/detect-language-in-zapier-translate.png "Detect Language in Zapier Translate")

1. Add an **action step** and select **"Translate by Zapier"**.
2. Choose the action: **"Detect Language"**
3. Map the **form submission content** (e.g., message field) to be analyzed.
4. Test the step to confirm Zapier detects the correct language.

### **Step 3: Add a Zapier Filter to Block Unwanted Languages**

![Zapier filter conditions setup with detected language rule.](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-filter-conditions-with-language-detection.png "Zapier Filter Conditions with Language Detection")

Now that Zapier can detect the language of a form submission, we need to **set up a filter** that blocks submissions in any language you don‚Äôt want to accept.

1. Add a **Filter by Zapier** step.
2. Set the filter condition:
3. * ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù does not contain ‚Äúen‚Äù (or any preferred language code).

If a form submission doesn‚Äôt match your preferred language, Zapier will stop the workflow right there and prevent it from reaching your inbox or CRM.

### **Pros and Cons of Translate by Zapier**

While Translate by Zapier is a helpful tool for filtering spam submissions based on language, it does have its limitations.

‚úÖ Simple and easy to set up

‚úÖ Works natively within Zapier

‚úÖ Detects and filters by language

‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt stop spam from bad IPs or disposable emails

‚ùå Can‚Äôt block spammy content beyond language detection

If language-based filtering isn‚Äôt enough, let‚Äôs talk about a stronger, machine learning spam filtering solution‚Äîthe OOPSpam Zapier app.

## **Using OOPSpam Zapier App for Language and Spam Filtering**

If your goal is spam detection based on language, [OOPSpam‚Äôs Zapier app](https://zapier.com/apps/oopspam/integrations) is the most advanced, machine learning solution available. Unlike basic language filtering tools, OOPSpam doesn‚Äôt just detect the language‚Äîit takes things further by analyzing email addresses, content, and even IP addresses to block spam at multiple levels.

### **Block by Language, IP, Email, and More with OOPSpam**

![OOPSpam integrations with Zapier automation.](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-zapier-integrations.png "OOPSpam Zapier Integrations")

**[OOPSpam ](https://www.oopspam.com/)**¬†(that‚Äôs us! üëã) uses a combination of machine learning filtering and real-time database checks to identify and block spam. Here‚Äôs what sets it apart:

* **Machine Learning Spam Detection:** Uses machine learning to analyze patterns and classify spam with a high level of accuracy.
* **Blocks Disposable & Temporary Emails:** Filters out submissions from one-time-use email services that spammers frequently exploit.
* **IP Reputation & Blacklist Checks:** Flags and blocks submissions from IPs associated with spam or bot activity.
* **Content Analysis & Spam Score Sensitivity:** Assigns a spam score to each submission based on message quality, keyword presence, and suspicious patterns.
* **Customizable Language Filtering:** Lets you allow or block specific languages, giving you precise control over what gets through.
* **Privacy-Focused & GDPR-Compliant:** Unlike some spam detection tools, OOPSpam doesn‚Äôt store or track user data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

## **How to Set Up OOPSpam in Zapier for Language Detection**

Now, let‚Äôs walk through the process of setting up OOPSpam‚Äôs Zapier integration to automatically detect and block spam form submissions.

### **Step 1: Add OOPSpam‚Äôs Spam Check Action in Zapier**

Before we start filtering, we need to connect OOPSpam to Zapier and ensure all form submissions go through a spam check.

![Google Forms response integrated with OOPSpam in Zapier.](/blog/assets/posts/oogle-forms-and-oopspam-integration-in-zapier.png "Google Forms and OOPSpam Integration in Zapier")

1. **Create a new Zap** in Zapier and select your **form app** (e.g., Typeform, Gravity Forms, Google Forms) as the trigger.
2. Click **‚Äú+ Add an action‚Äù** and search for **OOPSpam Anti-Spam**.
3. Choose the action event **‚ÄúCheck for Spam‚Äù**.
4. **Sign in to OOPSpam** by entering your **API key** (found in your OOPSpam account).
5. Click **Continue** to move to the next step.

### **Step 2: Configure the Spam Filtering Settings**

Once OOPSpam is connected, we need to configure the spam detection criteria to ensure maximum effectiveness.

![OOPSpam settings in Zapier with language and country filters.](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-filter-configuration-in-zapier.png "OOPSpam Filter Configuration in Zapier")

1Ô∏è. **Map the form submission fields** to OOPSpam‚Äôs analysis fields:

* **Email Address:** Select the form field containing the email address.
* **Content:** Select the field containing the message or form submission content.
* **Other Relevant Fields:** If needed, you can also pass IP addresses or other custom fields to improve filtering accuracy.

> **Why is this important?** Mapping these fields correctly ensures that OOPSpam evaluates the right data before assigning a Spam Score to each submission.

2. **Enable "Block Disposable Emails"**

This will automatically filter out any submissions from temporary or disposable email services like Guerrilla Mail, 10MinuteMail, and Mailinator, which are commonly used by spammers and bots.

3.. **Enable "Language Filtering"**

OOPSpam lets you filter form submissions based on language preferences, ensuring that only messages in the languages you support make it through. Under ‚Äú**Allow messages only in these languages**‚Äù, select your preferred language(s).

Any submission not matching the selected language(s) will be flagged and blocked.

4. **Allow or Block Messages Based on Country**

If your business only serves customers from specific countries, you can [restrict submissions by geographic location](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/blocking-countries-from-accessing-your-website-using-cloudflare).¬†

* Under "**Allow messages only from these countries**", select the countries where you want to accept submissions.
* Under "**Block messages from these countries"**, you can also manually [restrict specific countries](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/filter-spam-by-country) known for high spam activity. For instance, if you receive frequent spam from China or France, add them to the blocked list.

5. **Test the step to ensure OOPSpam correctly identifies spam and assigns a score.**

### **Step 3: Add a Zapier Filter to Stop Spam Submissions**

![Zapier filter conditions checking if spam score is less than 3.](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-spam-score-filter-configuration.png "Zapier Spam Score Filter Configuration")

Now that OOPSpam assigns a Spam Score to each submission, we need to set a filter in Zapier to automatically block spam.

1. Click **‚Äú+ Add an action‚Äù** and search for **Filter by Zapier**.¬†
2. Set the **filter condition**:

* "Spam Score" is less than 3 (You can adjust this based on how strict you want your filtering to be).

3. If the spam score exceeds the set threshold, the Zap stops processing the submission‚Äîmeaning spam never reaches your inbox.
4. If the submission passes the spam check, it proceeds to the next step (e.g., sending an email notification or adding to a CRM).

## **Advanced Ways to Use OOPSpam + Zapier**

OOPSpam‚Äôs integration with Zapier isn‚Äôt just about stopping spam‚Äîit helps you [manage submissions more effectively](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/5-common-spam-problems-in-zapier-how-to-fix-them). You can send flagged entries to Google Sheets or Airtable for manual review instead of deleting them immediately.

For borderline spam (e.g., spam score 2-3), set up an email alert for manual verification before processing. This adds an extra layer of review for important leads. By filtering out junk, only real customers make it into your CRM or email tools like [HubSpot](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/hubspot-contactform-spam) and [Mailchimp](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-stop-spam-signups-in-your-mailchimp-email-list), helping your team focus on quality leads.¬†

## **Final Thoughts**

While Translate by Zapier offers a basic way to filter spam based on language, it doesn‚Äôt stop bad actors from using disposable emails, blacklisted IPs, or harmful content. This is where OOPSpam‚Äôs advanced machine learning filtering provides a stronger, more reliable spam prevention system.
