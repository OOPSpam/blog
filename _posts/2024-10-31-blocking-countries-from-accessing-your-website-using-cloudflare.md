Controlling access to your website by country is simple. With Cloudflare, you can manage access based on visitors' locations, making it easy to limit certain countries from accessing your site. In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through setting up country restrictions with Cloudflare, weighing the pros and cons, and exploring alternative ways to keep your site accessible to a global audience without the spam.

## Why Block Access by Country?

Blocking countries might sound a bit drastic, but there are some good reasons to consider it:

* **Enhanced Security:** Limiting access to high-risk regions can help prevent malicious activity on your site.
* **Better Server Performance:** By reducing traffic from irrelevant or potentially harmful regions, you‚Äôll free up resources for genuine visitors.
* **Spam Reduction:** Many websites see spam or bot activity concentrated in specific regions, so blocking these countries can help.

Whether you‚Äôre looking to reduce spam or secure sensitive information, restricting country access can give you more control over who interacts with your site.

## How to Block Countries Using Cloudflare

With Cloudflare, blocking specific countries is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

### Sign In or Create an Account

First, log into your Cloudflare account. If you‚Äôre new to Cloudflare, you can sign up at [Cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com) for free.

![Cloudflare signup page with email, password, and CAPTCHA verification.](/blog/assets/posts/cloudflare-signup.png "Cloudflare Signup")

Complete the signup process by entering your **Email** and **Password**, then verify your identity using the "Verify you are human" checkbox.

### Add Your Website

Once logged in, add your website by clicking **Continue**. Cloudflare will scan your DNS records and set up your domain.

Select the **Free Plan** if you're looking to use basic features, including country blocking.

‚ú® **Quick note:** Subdomains aren‚Äôt supported on the free plan.

### Update Your Nameservers

To apply Cloudflare‚Äôs settings to your website, you‚Äôll need to [change your domain‚Äôs nameservers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimization/get-started/change-nameservers/). Follow Cloudflare‚Äôs instructions to update your domain‚Äôs nameservers, pointing them to Cloudflare‚Äôs nameservers. 

This process can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally.

Cloudflare will notify you by email once your nameservers are active.

### Access Security Settings

Once setup is complete, go to your Cloudflare dashboard. From there, navigate to **Security > WAF (Web Application Firewall)**.

### Create a New Rule

1. Select **Create a New Rule** and follow these steps:

   * **Name Your Rule:** Give it a recognizable name, like ‚ÄúBlock Countries.‚Äù
   * **Choose Countries to Block:**

     * Under **Field**, choose **Country** and enter the country names you want to block.
     * To add multiple countries, click **OR** to add another entry.
   * **Action:** Set the action to **Block**.
2. Hit **Save** to activate your rule!

### Test Your Setup

Once your rule is in place, test it using a VPN set to a blocked country to make sure it‚Äôs working as expected.

## Drawbacks of Blocking Entire Countries

While blocking countries has its perks, there are several important downsides to consider:

* **Reduced Reach:** Blocking regions can prevent legitimate users from accessing your site, potentially leading to lost traffic, customers, or clients from those areas.
* **SEO Impact:** Geo-blocking can negatively affect SEO by [limiting search engine crawlers' access](https://community.shopify.com/c/shopify-apps/can-geo-blocking-affect-my-site-s-seo/td-p/1950142), especially if they originate from blocked regions. This restriction might reduce your site‚Äôs visibility in search results or cause de-indexing in those areas. Google generally accepts geo-blocking, but inconsistent practices could trigger penalties.
* **User Experience:** Users from blocked countries may feel excluded or frustrated, impacting your brand's reputation. For businesses aiming for a global audience, this approach might be counterproductive.

If your primary goal is to reduce spam or protect user data, consider alternative methods like targeted spam filtering before committing to country-wide restrictions.
