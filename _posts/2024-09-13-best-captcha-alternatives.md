While traditional CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA is a popular choice, there are several other options available that might better suit your requirements. Let's explore some of the top CAPTCHA alternatives and see how they stack up.

## What is CAPTCHA?

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a security measure used on websites to make sure a visitor is a real person and not a computer program (or bot). It typically asks users to solve simple tasks like recognizing distorted text, selecting images, or clicking checkboxes. The goal is to block bots from performing harmful activities, such as spamming forms or creating fake accounts.
