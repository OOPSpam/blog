[Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) doesn‚Äôt have a built-in feature to block submissions by country or IP address, but there are effective ways to achieve country-level restrictions. Whether you want to limit the countries users can select in your forms or block spam entirely, this guide covers it all.

### **No Built-In Country Blocking in Gravity Forms**

Gravity Forms does not natively support country-based submission blocking. However, you can customize its Country Select field using filters or use third-party tools like **[OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** for more comprehensive blocking. If you need broader site-wide control, Cloudflare can help you block access from entire regions.

We‚Äôll go over both methods:

* Using Gravity Forms filters to add/remove countries from your forms.
* Integrating OOPSpam Anti-Spam (that‚Äôs us üëã) to [block spam](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-gravity-forms) and filter by country.
* Blocking entire countries at the server level with Cloudflare.

## **1. Block Countries in Gravity Forms Using Code**

One of Gravity Forms' features is its ability to be customized through hooks and filters. With a small code snippet, you can add or remove countries from the dropdown list of your [Country field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/addremove-countries-country-select-field/).

### **Using the `gform_countries` Filter**

You can edit your form‚Äôs country list by adding code to your functions.php file (in your active theme) or within a custom plugin.

#### **Example: Removing a Country**

To remove ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù from the list of countries, you can use:

```php
add_filter( 'gform_countries', 'remove_country' );

function remove_country( $countries ) {

    $key = array_search( 'United States', $countries );

    unset( $countries[ $key ] );

    return $countries;

}
```

This code uses `array_search` to find and remove the country from the list.

#### **Example: Adding a Country**

To add a custom country to the list, use:

```php
add_filter( 'gform_countries', 'add_country' );

function add_country( $countries ) {

    $countries[] = 'Custom Country';

    sort( $countries );

    return $countries;

}
```

### **Limiting Countries in a Single Form**

To restrict countries for one specific form (e.g., form ID 77), you can use form-specific filters like:

* `gform_pre_render_77`
* `gform_pre_validation_77`
* `gform_pre_submission_filter_77`
* `gform_admin_pre_render_77`

Replace **77** with the actual form ID.

## **2. Block Spam and Countries with OOPSpam Anti-Spam**

While filters are useful for customizing dropdowns, they won‚Äôt stop spam submissions from bots or unwanted countries. This is where OOPSpam Anti-Spam comes in. It [integrates seamlessly with Gravity Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/anti-spam-filter-for-gravity-forms) and offers real-time spam detection, country filtering, and detailed logs.

### **What OOPSpam Adds to Gravity Forms**

* **Country Filtering** ‚Äì Allow or block specific countries.
* **Language Filtering** ‚Äì Exclude certain languages.
* **Machine Learning Powered Spam Detection** ‚Äì Filters out [spammy behavior](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/why-is-gravity-forms-still-getting-spam-even-with-recaptcha) automatically.
* **Bot & Proxy Blocking** ‚Äì Stop spam from TOR, [VPNs](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-block-vpn-and-data-center-ip-submissions-in-gravity-forms), or proxies.
* **Rate Limiting** ‚Äì Prevents form abuse by [limiting submissions](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-limit-form-submissions-in-gravity-forms).
* **Detailed Logs** ‚Äì Shows blocked vs allowed entries with reasons.

### **How to Set It Up**

**Step 1: Install the Plugin**

Go to **Plugins > Add New**, search for **OOPSpam Anti-Spam**, install, and activate it.

* Allow submissions only from certain countries, or
* Block submissions from specific countries.

Save the settings, and **[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/)** will handle the rest.

### **Reviewing Blocked Submissions**

OOPSpam offers transparent spam [logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/) that include:

* IP address
* Email (if included in the form)
* Submission content
* Spam score
* Filtering reason
* Timestamp

You can review blocked and accepted entries directly in your WordPress dashboard:

or in the OOPSpam dashboard:

## **3. Block Entire Countries with Cloudflare**

If you want to stop all traffic from specific countries not just form entries‚Äîyou can do this at the network level with Cloudflare‚Äôs Web Application Firewall ([WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/)).

> **Important:** This method blocks the entire site for visitors from certain regions.

![Cloudflare](/blog/assets/posts/cloudflare-homepage.png "Cloudflare")

### **How to Set Up Country Blocking in Cloudflare**

![How to Set Up Country Blocking in Cloudflare](/blog/assets/posts/blocking-countries-in-cloudflare.png "How to Set Up Country Blocking in Cloudflare")

1. Log in to your[ Cloudflare account](https://cloudflare.com/).
2. Select your website.
3. Navigate to **Security > WAF > Firewall Rules**.
4. Click **Create Firewall Rule**.
5. Name the rule (e.g., ‚ÄúBlock Countries‚Äù).
6. Set conditions:
7. * **Field:** **`Country`**

   * **Operator:** **`is in`**

   * **Value:** Select the countries to block.
8. Action: **`Block`** and save the rule.

### **When to Use This**

* When you‚Äôre under attack from a specific region.
* To comply with geo-restrictions.
* To reduce server load from irrelevant traffic.

## **Final Thoughts**

Gravity Forms doesn‚Äôt have native country-blocking, but you can:

* Use filters (`gform_countries`) to limit available countries in your forms.
* Leverage OOPSpam for advanced country-based [spam filtering](https://www.oopspam.com/integrations/spam-protection-for-gravity-forms).
* Combine with Cloudflare for complete site-level protection when necessary.

With these methods, you can keep your forms clean and secure while still providing a [smooth user experience](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/gravityforms-block-user).
