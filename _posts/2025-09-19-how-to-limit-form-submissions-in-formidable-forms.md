Sometimes you donâ€™t want a form to stay open forever. Whether youâ€™re running a sign-up sheet, collecting job applications, or reserving seats for an event, there comes a point where submissions need to stop. [Formidable Forms](https://formidableforms.com/) makes this easy with its built-in scheduling and entry-limiting tools.

With just a few settings, you can decide when a form opens, when it closes, and how many responses it will accept.

## **Setting Up Form Limits in Formidable Forms**

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need to access your formâ€™s settings to enable scheduling and entry limits.

### **Step 1: Open the Formâ€™s Settings**

To begin, log into your WordPress dashboard and navigate to **Formidable Forms â†’ Forms**.Â 

Choose the form you want to manage and click on the **Settings** gear icon. This is where youâ€™ll find the scheduling and entry limit features.

### **Step 2: Configure Scheduling or Limits**

Inside the **Form Scheduling** settings, youâ€™ll be able to pick how the form should behave.

* Select **Closed** if you want the form to be unavailable until you reopen it.
* Choose **Schedule** to set a start and end date so the form only accepts responses during that window.
* Use **Limit entries** to cap the number of submissions.
* Combine **Schedule & Limit entries** to apply both time and entry restrictions.

This gives you flexibility depending on whether you want to stop submissions after a deadline, after a quota, or both.

### **Step 3: Save and Verify**

Click **Update** to apply your changes. Then test your form by submitting entries or checking the open/close dates. If the form hits the set cap or the deadline passes, users will see your custom message instead of the form.

### **Things to Keep in Mind**

* **Automatic cut-off**: If youâ€™ve set an entry limit, the form will stop taking submissions once the number is reached.
* **User messaging**: Add a custom message to explain why the form is closed, this keeps things clear for visitors.
* **Plan requirement**: Form Scheduling is only available in the Formidable Basic plan or higher, so free users will need to upgrade.

## **Advanced Rate Limiting Using OOPSpam**

While Formidableâ€™s built-in tools are powerful, sometimes you need more control. Thatâ€™s where **[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/)** (thatâ€™s us ðŸ‘‹) comes in. It adds per-IP and per-email rate-limiting to [stop abusive behavior](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-formidable) and spam bursts.

### **Setting Up Rate Limiting with OOPSpam**

To get started, install and activate the **[OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** plugin from the WordPress Plugin Repository. Once installed, [create an account](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login) on OOPSpamâ€™s site and generate your unique **API key**.Â

Enter this key under **OOPSpam â†’ General Settings** in your WordPress dashboard.

In the same tab, scroll and make sure to **activate spam protection** for [Formidable Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-formidable), so the plugin connects directly with your forms.

Next, open the **Rate Limiting** tab. Toggle the switch to **Enable Rate Limiting**. This ensures that all your forms will now follow the rules you configure.

You can now [customize how strict](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) you want to be:

* **Max Submissions per IP per Hour** lets you stop multiple entries from a single IP address.
* **Max Submissions per Email per Hour** prevents repeat abuse from the same email address.
* **Block Duration** defines how long a user is blocked after exceeding the limit.
* **Data Clean-Up Frequency** clears old tracking logs to keep your site running smoothly.

Finally, click **Save Changes**. Test by attempting multiple [submissions](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/) from the same source to make sure your settings are applied correctly.Â 

> Start with flexible rules if your form receives heavy traffic, and tighten them if you see abuse continuing.

## **Final thoughts**

Formidable Forms gives you the tools to control how many entries a form accepts and when. By adding OOPSpamâ€™s rate-limiting on top, you can [block spam](https://www.oopspam.com/integrations/spam-protection-for-formidable), stop duplicate entries, and keep submissions under control.
