[Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/cloudflare-turnstile) is a user-friendly, privacy-first [CAPTCHA alternative](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/best-captcha-alternatives) thatâ€™s becoming popular with WordPress users. But it can run into issuesâ€”especially with form plugins. This guide covers common Turnstile errors in WordPress forms and how to fix them fast.

## **Why Cloudflare Turnstile Errors Happen in WordPress**

Turnstile issues usually come down to misconfigurations, plugin conflicts, browser-related problems, or expired credentials. WordPress adds complexity due to its wide variety of themes, plugins, and caching systemsâ€”all of which can interfere with how Turnstile renders or validates.

Weâ€™ve seen several recurring errors across [forums](https://community.cloudflare.com/), especially from form users. Letâ€™s go over them one by one.

### **1. "Cloudflare Turnstile verification failed, please try again later."**

![Cloudflare Turnstile verification failed, please try again later.](/blog/assets/posts/cloudflare-turnstile-verification-failed.png "Cloudflare Turnstile verification failed")

This is one of the most common Turnstile error messages in WordPress. It often appears after submitting a form.

#### **Cause:**

This usually happens when the Site Key or Secret Key entered is incorrect. Another common reason is interference from caching plugins like Breeze or WP Rocket, which may prevent Turnstile from loading properly. Sometimes, the issue stems from browser cache or extensions that block necessary scripts.

#### **How to Fix:**

![Double-check your Site Key and Secret Key in the Turnstile plugin settings.](/blog/assets/posts/turnstile-api-key-settings.png "Turnstile plugin settings")

* Double-check your **Site Key** and **Secret Key** in the Turnstile plugin settings.
* Disable caching plugins temporarily, or exclude the form page from cache.
* Clear both your browser and site cache.
* Try submitting the form in an Incognito window to rule out browser issues.

### **2. Turnstile Widget Not Displaying on Form**

![Turnstile Widget Not Displaying on Form](/blog/assets/posts/turnstile-widget.png "Turnstile Widget ")

Sometimes, the Turnstile CAPTCHA box doesnâ€™t appear at all.

#### **Cause:**

The Turnstile widget wonâ€™t appear if [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is disabled in the browser. Conflicts between your theme or other plugins may prevent it from rendering. In some cases, minified or combined scripts break the Turnstile widgetâ€™s ability to load correctly.

#### **How to Fix:**

* Confirm that **JavaScript is enabled** in your browser.
* Temporarily disable ad blockers or privacy extensions.
* Check for JavaScript errors using browser DevTools console.
* Exclude Turnstile scripts from minification in caching/CDN plugins.

### **3. Form Submission Blocked Even After Passing Turnstile**

A particularly frustrating issue is when users solve the Turnstile challenge, but the form doesnâ€™t submit.

#### **Affected Plugins:**

This issue can happen with any WordPress form builder, but weâ€™ve seen the most reports from users of:Â 

* [Fluent Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-fluent-forms)
* [Forminator](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-forminator)
* [Elementor Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-elementor-forms)

#### **Cause:**

[AJAX-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) form submissions sometimes bypass the Turnstile verification token. File upload fields in forms, especially in Forminator, can also interfere with how the plugin processes verification. Some plugins may also skip server-side token validation entirely.

#### **How to Fix:**

* Temporarily remove file upload fields for testing
* Ensure your form plugin version is updated
* Check whether the plugin supports Turnstile officially, or use the Simple Cloudflare Turnstile plugin to manage validation
* Manually add token verification if using a custom form

### **4. "Invalid sitekey" or "Invalid domain" Errors**

!["Invalid domain" Cloudflare Turnstile Errors](/blog/assets/posts/invalid-domain-errors.png "\"Invalid domain\" Errors")

These errors are typically due to incorrect settings in your Cloudflare dashboard.

#### **Error Codes:**

* `110100`: Invalid sitekey
* `110200`: Unknown domain

#### **How to Fix:**

* Visit your Cloudflare Turnstile dashboard and verify:
* * The correct sitekey is being used
  * Your domain is listed under **Allowed Domains**

### **5. "Invalid action" or "Invalid cData"**

These are client-side errors, commonly triggered by incorrectly formatted inputs.

#### **Error Codes:**

* `110420`: Invalid action
* `110430`: Invalid cData

#### **How to Fix:**

* Make sure the action and any `cData` parameters in your widget script follow the required format
* Use alphanumeric characters and avoid special symbols
* Follow Turnstileâ€™s documentation for proper configuration

### **6. Turnstile Challenge Timeout**

![Turnstile Challenge Timeout](/blog/assets/posts/turnstile-challenge-timeout.png "Turnstile Challenge Timeout")

#### **Error Codes:**

* `110600`, `110620`

#### **Cause:**

These errors occur when a user takes too long to solve the challenge or if their deviceâ€™s system clock is out of sync. An outdated widget or time discrepancy can cause the verification to expire.

#### **How to Fix:**

* Ask the user to refresh the page and retry
* Ensure the system clock is synced correctly
