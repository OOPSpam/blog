Spam submissions from certain regions can overwhelm your inbox, waste resources, and lead to security issues. If you're using **[Fluent Forms](https://fluentforms.com/)**, you have multiple ways to restrict or block form submissions based on a user‚Äôs location. In this guide, we'll cover:

1. Fluent Forms‚Äô built-in country-based restriction feature.
2. OOPSpam plugin for advanced filtering and logging.
3. Cloudflare firewall rules to block entire countries at the DNS level.

## **1. Block Countries Using Fluent Forms‚Äô Built-In Country Filter**

Fluent Forms offers a native way to restrict form submissions by country or IP address‚Äîno extra plugins required. But before you can enable these restrictions, you‚Äôll need to configure the **Geo-Location Provider** in the global settings.

### **Step 1: Set Up Geo-Location**

Go to **Fluent Forms > Global Settings** in your WordPress dashboard. Scroll down to the **Geo-Location Provider** section and fill in the required information. Without this, Fluent Forms won‚Äôt be able to detect user IPs or geolocation.

Once that‚Äôs saved, you‚Äôre ready to apply restrictions to individual forms.

### **Step 2: Open the Form‚Äôs Settings**

Select the form you want to protect. Go to **Settings & Integrations**, then click on the **Scheduling & Restrictions** tab.

Toggle on **Restrict Form Submission** to activate the restriction options. You‚Äôll now see two checkboxes:

* IP-Based Restriction
* Country-Based Restriction

#### **Restricting by Country**

Check the **Country-Based Restriction** box. From the dropdown, select the countries you want to block or allow. You can select one or multiple countries.

Once selected, save your settings. Submissions from restricted countries will now be blocked.

## **2. Advanced Country Blocking in Fluent Forms Using OOPSpam**

If spam persists even with Fluent Forms‚Äô built-in filter or if you're seeing suspicious patterns from rotating IPs or bots‚Äî**[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/)** (that‚Äôs us üëã) offers an advanced solution.

### **What OOPSpam Adds to Fluent Forms**

* **Machine Learning-backed Filtering**: Uses machine learning to detect and [block spam from Fluent Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-fluent-forms).
* **Country Filtering**: Choose countries to block or allow.
* **Submission Logs**: View blocked entries and review spam attempts.
* **Block by Language**: Filter out submissions written in specific languages you want to exclude.
* **Block VPNs, Tor, Proxies, and Server-Based Spam**: Automatically detect and block spam coming from anonymized or automated sources‚Äîincluding bots, data centers, and suspicious IP networks.

### **How to Set It Up**

![Paste your API key from your OOPSpam account.](/blog/assets/posts/my-api-key-field.png "Paste your API key from your OOPSpam account.")

Paste your **API key** from your [OOPSpam account](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Register). Then **activate spam protection**.

OOPSpam will now actively [filter submissions in your Fluent Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/fluentforms-block-user)‚Äîwithout blocking access to the rest of your website.

### **Review Blocked Submissions**

OOPSpam gives you access to **[submission logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/)**. You‚Äôll know which entries were blocked and why, so you can:

* Spot trends in abuse.
* Follow up with legitimate users (if needed).
* Adjust your filtering over time.

## **3. Blocking Countries from Your Website Entirely Using Cloudflare**

If your concerns go beyond form spam and into site-wide abuse, **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)** can block traffic from entire countries before it ever reaches your server.

‚ö†Ô∏è This approach blocks the entire website‚Äînot just your Fluent Forms.

### **How to Set Up Country Blocking in Cloudflare**

![Cloudflare](/blog/assets/posts/cloudflare-homepage.png "Cloudflare")

Cloudflare‚Äôs **Web Application Firewall ([WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/ppc/waf-x/))** allows you to create rules based on visitor IP geolocation. This means users from selected countries won‚Äôt be able to load your website at all.

### **How to Set It Up**

Log into your **[Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)** and select your site. Go to the **Security** section, then open the **WAF** tab and click on **Firewall Rules**.

![How to Set Up Country Blocking in Cloudflare WAF](/blog/assets/posts/blocking-countries-in-cloudflare.png "How to Set Up Country Blocking in Cloudflare WAF")

Create a new rule. Give it a name like ‚ÄúBlock Countries.‚Äù Choose Country as the field, is in as the operator, and select the countries to block. Set the action to **Block**, save your changes, and deploy the rule.

Cloudflare will now block access to your entire site from those countries.

If you're looking to set up country-level blocking with Cloudflare, our article: [Blocking Countries from Accessing Your Website Using Cloudflare](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/blocking-countries-from-accessing-your-website-using-cloudflare) walks you through the process.

### **When to Use This**

* You‚Äôre experiencing [DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), brute-force login attempts, or content scraping from specific regions.
* You have legal or compliance reasons for limiting access to users in certain countries.
* You want to dramatically reduce server load from unwanted traffic.

*This method is [powerful but strict](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/common-cloudflare-turnstile-errors-in-wordpress-forms-and-how-to-fix-them)‚Äîso avoid it if you're only dealing with form spam.*

## **Which Country Blocking Method Is Best?**

    padding: 10px;
    text-align: left;

**Recommendation:**

Use Fluent Forms‚Äô built-in country blocking for quick setup on smaller forms. Use OOPSpam if you need smarter filtering, [rate limiting](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-limit-form-submissions-in-fluent-forms), [IP filtering](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-block-vpn-and-data-center-ip-submissions-in-fluent-forms), spam behavior detection, and submission logs. And use Cloudflare if your entire site is under attack or needs country-level restrictions for legal reasons.

## **Final Thoughts**

Fluent Forms gives you a solid starting point for country-based form restrictions, but for most users dealing with serious spam or abuse, OOPSpam provides the most complete solution.

If you‚Äôre looking to protect your Fluent Forms from spam by region, start with form-level filtering and add more layers only as needed.

OOPSpam integrates with [WPForms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-block-countries-in-wpforms), Elementor Forms, Contact Form 7, [SureForms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-block-countries-in-sureforms), and more.
