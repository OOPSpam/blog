Spam and abuse can turn even the most well-designed forms into a source of frustration. For WordPress users, forms play a vital role in facilitating meaningful interactions—whether you’re capturing leads, gathering survey responses, or managing event sign-ups.

However, when bots and malicious actors flood your forms with junk submissions, it wastes time, consumes resources, and lowers the quality of your data.

[Fluent Forms](https://fluentforms.com/) is a powerful and flexible tool for creating forms, but securing them requires more advanced measures beyond its default protections. In this blog, we’ll guide you through enhancing Fluent Forms security using OOPSpam’s rate limiting to prevent spam submissions.

You’ll discover how to block excessive entries while maintaining a smooth experience for genuine users.

## What Is Rate Limiting, and Why Is It Essential?

[Rate limiting](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) acts like a gatekeeper for your forms. It restricts how many times a user can submit a form within a set timeframe.

For example, you could allow a maximum of three submissions per hour, helping to reduce spam while accommodating legitimate users.

### Why Rate Limiting Matters

Bots and bad actors exploit forms in multiple ways, such as:

* **System Overload:** High submission volumes can slow or crash your website.
* **Cluttered Data:** Spam entries make it difficult to identify real submissions.
* **Poor User Experience:** Malicious activity can lead to website slowdowns, affecting legitimate users.

With rate limiting, you can maintain website security and provide a seamless experience while preserving the integrity of your data.

## The Common Challenges of Fluent Forms Without Rate Limiting

![A page for Fluent Forms, described as "The Fastest Form Plugin for WordPress," showcasing features like contact forms, payment forms, and calculators.](/blog/assets/posts/header.png "Fluent Forms - The Fastest WordPress Form Plugin for Businesses")

Fluent Forms is an exceptional tool for creating forms, but even its robust features have limitations when it comes to spam protection. Without advanced measures like rate limiting, you may face challenges such as:

* **Spam Submissions:** Bots can flood your forms with hundreds of entries in seconds, overwhelming your inbox.
* **Duplicate Entries:** Users may accidentally hit “Submit” multiple times, creating redundant data.
* **Brute Force Attacks:** Hackers may target your login or registration forms to gain unauthorized access.

With bots making up [over 40%](https://futurecio.tech/bots-compose-42-of-overall-web-traffic-study-finds/) of web traffic and [69% of spam](https://www.oopspam.com/2024-spam-report) targeting WordPress sites, adding advanced protection like OOPSpam is crucial for mitigating these vulnerabilities.
