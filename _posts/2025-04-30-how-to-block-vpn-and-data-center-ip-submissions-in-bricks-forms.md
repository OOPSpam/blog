[Bricks](https://bricksbuilder.io/) builder gives developers and designers powerful tools to build fast, modern WordPress sites‚Äîincluding easy-to-integrate forms. But if you're using Bricks Forms, you've likely faced the issue of spam submissions. Many of these come from bots leveraging VPNs and cloud infrastructure to bypass filters.

In this guide, we‚Äôll explain why blocking VPN and data center traffic is essential for spam protection in Bricks Forms‚Äîand how to do it either manually via Cloudflare or instantly with the OOPSpam WordPress plugin.

## **Why VPN and Cloud IP Blocking Matters in Bricks Forms**

Bots today don‚Äôt rely on old-school spam tactics. Instead, they use:

* [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) to obscure their real location
* Proxies to rapidly change identities
* Cloud servers like AWS, Hetzner, and Azure to automate and scale spam attacks

If you‚Äôre seeing odd contact form messages, fake leads, or suspicious submissions in your Bricks Forms, these IP sources are likely to blame.

### **Blocking VPNs**

VPNs allow attackers to submit forms without revealing their actual IP address. Blocking VPN traffic can reduce spam significantly‚Äîbut some real users (like remote workers or people in restrictive regions) may also rely on VPNs, so use this filter mindfully.

### **Blocking Cloud Providers**

Most spam bots operate from cloud infrastructure, not from ordinary home or mobile networks. Blocking traffic from known cloud IPs is a safer and more effective option for preventing:

* Fake account signups
* Automated spam
* Suspicious lead capture entries

Where standard filters react to known spam patterns, blocking VPN and cloud IPs proactively stops new threats‚Äîbefore they reach your form inbox.

> You can also use tools like **[IP Reputation Check](https://ipreputationcheck.com/)** to verify if an IP is associated with VPNs or data centers.

## **Method 1: Manually Block VPN and Cloud Traffic with Cloudflare Firewall**

![Cloudflare Firewall](/blog/assets/posts/cloud-based-waf-security-web-application-firewall-cloudflare.png "Cloudflare Firewall")

If your site is using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can manually create firewall rules to stop unwanted traffic from known networks.

### **How It Works**

Every network provider (including cloud platforms and VPN services) has a unique identifier called an [ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (Autonomous System Number). Cloudflare lets you block these ASNs.

![Cloudflare ASN Settings](/blog/assets/posts/cloudflare_was_asn.png "Cloudflare ASN Settings")

**Example:** To stop traffic from DigitalOcean, you can block **ASN AS14061** in your Cloudflare dashboard.

### **Drawbacks**

* **Manual upkeep required:** ASNs and IP blocks change over time
* **Risk of overblocking:** You might accidentally block legitimate users using VPNs or cloud-hosted services
* **Requires technical knowledge:** You'll need to research offending networks, identify their ASNs, and apply rules

This method is best suited for developers or site managers comfortable with network-level tools.

## **Method 2: Block VPN and Cloud IPs in Bricks Forms with OOPSpam (One-Click Setup)**
