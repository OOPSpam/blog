Spam submissions can be a real headache. Whether you’re collecting leads, feedback, or registrations, they can quickly clutter your Airtable forms, waste your time, and make it harder to focus on what matters. Wouldn’t it be great if you could handle them automatically?

With [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), you can. This easy-to-set-up system filters out spam for you, leaving your Airtable forms clean and ready for real, useful submissions. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to set it up step by step, so you can save time and focus on what’s truly important.

## Why Airtable Forms Need Spam Prevention

[Airtable forms](https://support.airtable.com/docs/getting-started-with-airtable-form-views) are a popular choice for collecting and organizing data because of their intuitive design and easy customization. However, like all online forms, they are prone to spam submissions. Here's why preventing spam is critical:

1. **Protecting Data Integrity:** Spam submissions distort your data, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights or analytics.
2. **Saving Time:** Manually sifting through spam submissions is tedious and takes focus away from other important tasks.
3. **Enhancing Productivity:** Automated workflows ensure that only valid submissions are processed, helping you focus on legitimate leads.

Integrating OOPSpam into your Airtable form workflow via Zapier offers a seamless and efficient way to eliminate spam, allowing you to concentrate on what truly matters.

### Key Features of Airtable, OOPSpam, and Zapier

Before we get into the setup process, let’s briefly highlight the role of each tool:

1. **Airtable:** A versatile database that allows you to collect and organize form submissions with customizable fields and views.
2. **OOPSpam:** A machine learning spam detection tool that analyzes submissions based on multiple factors, including message content, email validity, and spam trends.
3. **Zapier:** An automation platform that connects Airtable and OOPSpam, enabling real-time spam detection and response workflows.

### Using Zapier’s Copilot for an Easy Start

Zapier has introduced a new feature called [Copilot](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-copilot-guide/), which simplifies setting up workflows. With Copilot, you can describe your workflow in natural language, and it will create the foundational steps for you. 

![Zapier Copilot interface showing steps for setting up a Zap to filter spam submissions in Airtable using OOPSpam.](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-copilot-setup.png "Zapier Copilot Setup for Spam Filtering")

> For example, I just copy-pasted the title of this article into Copilot, and it instantly created a Zap with the following steps:

1. New Record in Airtable (trigger)
2. Check for Spam in OOPSpam (action)
3. Update Record in Airtable (action)

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Airtable Base and Form

### Create a New Airtable Base

Airtable is the foundation of this workflow. To get started:

**1. Log into Airtable:** If you don’t have an account, create one at [Airtable](https://airtable.com/signup).

![Airtable sign-up page with email input and multiple login options.](/blog/assets/posts/sign-up-airtable.png "Airtable Sign-Up Page")

**2. Create a New Base:** Name it something like "Spam Filtered Submissions."

![Airtable interface showing an empty table for spam-filtered submissions with columns for Name, Email, Message, Spam Score, and Submission Date.](/blog/assets/posts/spam-filtered-submissions-table-airtable.png "Airtable Spam-Filtered Submissions Table")

**3. Add Relevant Fields:**

* **Name:** Single-line text
* **Email:** Email field
* **Message:** Long text
* **Spam Score:** Number field
* **Submission Date:** Date field (set to auto-populate)

### Create and Customize a Form View

![Airtable sample form with fields for name, email, and message.](/blog/assets/posts/sample-form-airtable.png "Airtable Sample Form Layout")

1. **Switch to Form View:** In your Airtable table, click on Form to create a shareable form view.
2. **Add Necessary Fields:** Include fields like Name, Email, and Message to capture essential data.
3. **Enable Public Sharing:** Share the form link with your audience or embed it on your website.

## Step 2: Preparing Zapier and OOPSpam for Integration

### Set Up Zapier

![Zapier login page with multiple sign-in options.](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-login.png "Zapier Login Page")

Zapier acts as the bridge between Airtable and OOPSpam. Here’s how to prepare:

1. **Sign Up for Zapier:** Create a free account at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/sign-up).
2. **Familiarize Yourself with Zaps:** A "[Zap](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496309697421-What-is-a-Zap)" is an automated workflow that connects two or more apps.

### Set Up OOPSpam

![OOPSpam Dashboard Overview with API Usage and Testing Features](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-dashboard-.png "OOPSpam Dashboard Overview with API Usage and Testing Features")

OOPSpam’s robust spam-detection capabilities ensure accurate results.

1. **Sign Up for OOPSpam:** Visit OOPSpam and [create an account](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Register).
2. **Retrieve Your API Key:** Log into your dashboard and copy your unique API Key. This will be used to connect [OOPSpam to Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/oopspam/integrations).

## Step 3: Building the Workflow in Zapier

### Add Airtable as the Trigger

**1. Create a New Zap**

* Log into Zapier and click “**Create Zap**.”
* Name your Zap (e.g., "Filter Airtable Spam").

**2. Select Airtable as the Trigger App:** Choose Airtable and select the event "New Record".

![Zapier setup screen showing a new record trigger event in Airtable.](/blog/assets/posts/zap-zapier.png "Zapier Workflow: Airtable New Record Trigger Configuration")

**3. Connect Your Airtable Account:** Provide access to Zapier and select the base and table where your form submissions are stored.

**4. Configuring the Airtable Trigger:**

![Airtable configuration in Zapier for new record creation with sample form view.](/blog/assets/posts/configuring-new-record-in-airtable.png "Configuring New Record in Airtable with Zapier")

* Once connected, select the **Base** (e.g., "Spam Filtered Submissions") from the dropdown.
* For the **Table**, choose the table where your form submissions are stored (e.g., "Table 1").
* Under **Limit to View**, select the view you want Zapier to monitor (e.g., "Grid view"). If you only have one view, this will be the default.
* Leave the **Include Attachment Content** option as "Yes" if your form includes file uploads, ensuring attachments are processed in the trigger.

**5. Test the Trigger:** Submit a sample form entry and confirm that Zapier retrieves the data correctly.

### Add OOPSpam to Analyze Submissions

![Zapier integration setup showing Airtable and OOPSpam spam check configuration.](/blog/assets/posts/filter-airtable-spam-zapier.png "Zapier Workflow: Airtable Integration with OOPSpam")

**1. Add OOPSpam as the Action**

* Click the "**+**" button in your Zap and search for **OOPSpam**.
* Select the action event "**Check for Spam**".

**2. Connect OOPSpam**

* Enter your **API Key** to authenticate the connection.

**3. Map Airtable Fields to OOPSpam**

![OOPSpam configuration in Zapier for spam filtering with specific content and email settings.](/blog/assets/posts/configuring-spam-check-in-oopspam.png "Configuring Spam Check in OOPSpam via Zapier")

Map the data fields from your Airtable trigger to OOPSpam’s input fields:

* **Content:** Map the "**Message**" field from Airtable. This is the text you want to check for spam (e.g., customer messages or form responses).
* **Sender IP:** Leave this field empty, as Airtable forms do not collect IP addresses.
* **Email:** Map the "**Email**" field from Airtable. This will help OOPSpam verify if the email is valid and not disposable.

**4. Configure Spam Detection Settings** 

Fine-tune OOPSpam’s settings to customize how spam is detected:

* **Consider Short Messages as Spam:** Set to **False**, unless you expect your message field to contain a sentence with at least 20 characters. This ensures short but legitimate responses are not flagged as spam unnecessarily.
* **Log Submissions to OOPSpam:** Set to **False**, unless you want to store all submissions for further analysis in your OOPSpam dashboard.
* **Block Temporary/Disposable Emails:** Set to **True** to filter out submissions from temporary or fake email addresses.

### Handle Submissions with Spam Scores in Airtable

After setting up the OOPSpam action, the next step is to ensure that every submission is updated in Airtable with its corresponding spam score. This allows you to review and filter submissions directly within Airtable, leveraging its intuitive filtering and sorting tools.

#### Update Airtable with Spam Scores

![Zapier workflow integrating Airtable and OOPSpam for spam checking and record updating.](/blog/assets/posts/airtable-and-oopspam-integration.png "Airtable and OOPSpam Integration Workflow")

1. **Add Airtable as the Action App:** Select [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) and choose "**Update Record**."
2. **Map OOPSpam Results to Airtable:** Map the spam score from OOPSpam back to the "Spam Score" field in Airtable.

   * **Spam Score Guide:**
   * **1-2:** Not spam
   * **3-6:** Spam
3. **Test the Update:** Submit a sample form entry and verify that Airtable is updated with the correct spam score and other relevant details.

#### Leverage Airtable for Spam Management

Once the spam score is stored in Airtable, you can take advantage of its features to organize and manage your submissions:

* **Filter Submissions by Spam Score:** Use Airtable's filtering feature to view only submissions with a spam score below your preferred threshold (e.g., less than 3).
* **Sort Entries by Spam Score:** Quickly identify and review high-score entries that may need further inspection.
* **Tag Submissions:** Add custom fields or tags to categorize submissions as "Spam" or "Legitimate."

> 📌 Here’s an example of how your Airtable table might look after implementing this setup:

![Airtable table displaying names, emails, messages, spam scores, and submission dates.](/blog/assets/posts/filtered-submissions-table-in-airtable.png "Filtered Submissions Table in Airtable")

#### Why This Approach Works?

* **Complete Transparency:** By recording all submissions, you retain the flexibility to review both legitimate and flagged entries.
* **Customizable Workflow:** Airtable allows you to create personalized views and apply filters as needed, rather than relying on pre-filtering in Zapier.
* **Effortless Management:** Keep all data in one place, simplifying the review process and enabling better data integrity.

With this setup, Airtable becomes your central hub for submission management, helping you focus on meaningful insights without worrying about spam clutter.

### 📌 Optional: Send Notifications for Legitimate Submissions

* Use Gmail, Outlook or [Zapier's Email](https://zapier.com/apps/email/integrations) app to notify your team of valid submissions.

  * **Set Conditions for Notifications:** Only send emails for submissions with a spam score below your threshold.
  * **Customize the Email Template:** Include fields like Name, Email, and Message to provide context.

## Step 4: Testing and Fine-Tuning

### Test the Entire Workflow

* Submit both legitimate and spammy entries through your Airtable form.
* Check Zapier logs to confirm:

  * Spam submissions are flagged and blocked.
  * Legitimate submissions pass through and update Airtable.

> This screenshot shows spam entries collected from form submissions. All these entries are identified as spam and are stored in Airtable for review. This setup helps you filter out junk submissions while still being able to analyze spam patterns later if needed. Use this as a reference for how your Airtable table might look after implementing this workflow.

### Adjust Settings as Needed

* Experiment with the spam score threshold to balance sensitivity and accuracy.
* Review flagged submissions in Airtable to identify patterns and refine your filters.

## Step 5: Publish and Monitor

![Publishing progress screen for a Zap in Zapier.](/blog/assets/posts/zap-publishing.png "Zap Publishing Progress Screen")

1. **Monitor Airtable Logs:** Regularly review the “Spam Score” field to identify false positives or negatives.
2. **Optimize Workflow:** Add additional steps, such as auto-tagging submissions or archiving spam entries for later review.
3. **Scale as Needed:** Integrate other apps like [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/) to store backups or analytics platforms for insights.

## Final Thoughts

Managing spam submissions doesn’t have to be a time-consuming hassle.
