[Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/) Contact Form does not support country blocking by default. To stop spam or unwanted traffic, you can use [OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) (that‚Äôs us üëã)¬† to filter submissions by region or set up [Cloudflare Firewall Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/) to block visitors from entire countries before they reach your site.

## **Option 1: Block Countries in Beaver Builder Contact Form with OOPSpam**

[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) works directly with Beaver Builder forms. It lets you choose which countries can submit your forms and [blocks spam entries](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-beaver-builder) from regions you don‚Äôt want.

### **Key Features**

* Country filtering to allow or block submissions.
* Language filtering for entries in unwanted languages.
* Set [submission frequency](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) rules to stop abuse.
* Machine based-based spam detection that catches bots and automated submissions.
* Blocking of proxies, VPNs, and TOR traffic.
* Submission [logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/) that show what was blocked and why.

### **How to Set It Up**

Install the **OOPSpam Anti-Spam** plugin from your WordPress dashboard. Create an account at[ OOPSpam.com](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login) and generate an API key.

## **Option 2: Block Entire Countries with Cloudflare**

If your problem is bigger than spam, such as brute force logins, DDoS attacks, or scraping, you can block traffic at the network level with Cloudflare.

### **How to Do It**

1. [Log in](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) to your Cloudflare account.
2. Go to **Security > WAF > Firewall Rules**.
3. Create a new rule and name it ‚ÄúBlock Countries.‚Äù
4. Set the field to **Country**, the operator to **is in**, and select the countries to block.
5. Set the action to **Block** and save.

Visitors from those countries will now be denied access to your entire site.

## **Final thoughts**

Beaver Builder Contact Form alone cannot stop submissions from specific countries. The easiest fix is to use OOPSpam to filter form entries by region. This gives you targeted control over who can submit your forms.

If the issue extends beyond form spam and affects your whole site, Cloudflare Firewall can block traffic from unwanted countries at the server level.

Together, these tools give you both form-level control and site-wide security.
