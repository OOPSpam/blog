Failed orders with an "Unknown" origin in [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) are a growing problem, mainly caused by automated card testing attacks. These attacks flood your store with thousands of failed transactions, clogging up your orders, damaging your email reputation, and even affecting payment processing. Fortunately, there's a quick way to stop them.

## **Why WooCommerce Stores Get Failed Orders with Unknown Origin**

### **The Problem: Card Testing Attacks on WooCommerce**

[Card testing](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/card-testing-attacks-a-new-threat-vector-through-woocommerce-block-based-checkout) is when fraudsters use automated bots to test stolen credit cards on checkout pages. They attempt thousands of transactions in a short time, looking for valid card details.

With WooCommerce, this can happen when:

* **Checkout security is bypassed.** Traditional security tools might not catch API-based attacks.
* **Bots exploit block-based and classic checkouts.** Attackers target multiple checkout methods, including REST and legacy APIs.
* **WooCommerce processes the order attempt before verifying fraud.** This results in a flood of failed transactions.

### **How to Identify This Attack**

If you’re seeing a sudden spike in failed transactions marked **"Unknown"** under the order origin, your store is likely under attack. These failed orders typically:

* Appear in bulk, sometimes in the thousands within a short period.
* Have no valid customer details, often using fake, auto-generated email addresses and addresses.
* Use PayPal as the preferred payment method, but can also target credit cards.
* Use small, random transaction amounts.

## **Quick Fix: Enable OOPSpam Protection in WooCommerce**

The fastest way to stop these failed orders is by enabling two key settings in the[OOPSpam WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/).

### **1. Enable Spam Protection for WooCommerce**

This setting automatically blocks spam orders before they enter your system, filtering transactions across classic checkout, block checkout, the REST API, and legacy API.

**How to enable it:**

![WooCommerce spam protection settings enabled.](/blog/assets/posts/woocommerce-spam-protection-configuration.png "WooCommerce Spam Protection")

1. Go to **WordPress Dashboard** → **OOPSpam Settings**.
2. Navigate to **WooCommerce Spam Protection**.
3. Toggle **Activate Spam Protection** for WooCommerce.

### **2. Block Orders from Unknown Origin**

This setting blocks suspicious transactions before they reach your WooCommerce order list.

**How to enable it:**

1. In **OOPSpam Settings**, locate **Block Orders from Unknown Origin**.
2. Toggle it **ON** to prevent bot-generated orders.

## **Additional Security Steps to Strengthen WooCommerce Protection**

While OOPSpam will handle most spam orders, adding extra security layers can further reduce risks and protect your checkout page.

### **Limit Checkout Attempts**

![Rate limiting settings with options for max submissions and block duration.](/blog/assets/posts/rate-limiting-settings.png "Rate Limiting Configuration Settings")

Restrict the number of failed transactions from the same IP address to prevent automated bots from repeatedly trying stolen card details. [OOPSpam’s Rate Limiting feature](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) helps prevent bulk spam attempts by setting a limit on checkout requests.

### **Enable CAPTCHA on Checkout**

Adding [CAPTCHA](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/best-captcha-alternatives) verification prevents bots from making automated checkout attempts. The [Simple Cloudflare Turnstile plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-cloudflare-turnstile/) is a quick and easy way to integrate CAPTCHA into your WooCommerce store.

### **Restrict Checkout by Country**

If your store receives repeated spam orders from specific locations, country-based blocking can be an effective measure. You can use [Cloudflare](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/blocking-countries-from-accessing-your-website-using-cloudflare) or OOPSpam’s built-in country blocking to restrict high-risk regions.

### **Block Cloud Providers and VPNs** 

Spammers often use data centers and cloud providers to run automated attacks. Enabling **Block Cloud Providers** in OOPSpam helps prevent spam originating from these sources.

If spam is coming from anonymous networks, the **Block VPNs** setting can also be activated to block submissions from VPN users. However, be cautious, as this may affect legitimate customers using VPNs for privacy.

## **A WooCommerce Store with No Failed Orders After Using OOPSpam**

After enabling [OOPSpam’s Spam Protection for WooCommerce](https://www.oopspam.com/woocommerce) and Blocking Orders from Unknown Origin, store owners have reported a complete stop to failed transactions from Unknown origin. The following image shows a store that successfully eliminated spam orders after activating these settings:

## **Moving Forward**

Card testing attacks aren’t just frustrating—they can harm your store’s reputation and operations. But stopping them is easy:

* Enable Spam Protection for WooCommerce in OOPSpam.
* Block Orders from Unknown Origin to prevent bot-generated spam.
* Add extra security like rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and country restrictions.

With these steps, your WooCommerce store stays secure and spam-free—no more dealing with thousands of failed orders. [Enable OOPSpam protection](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Register) now before your store gets hit again.
