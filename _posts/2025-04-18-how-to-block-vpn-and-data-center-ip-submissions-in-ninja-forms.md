![Block VPN and Data Center IP Submissions in Ninja Forms](/blog/assets/posts/free-drag-drop-form-builder-for-wordpress-download-now-04-17-2025_03_10_pm.png "Ninja Forms")

[Ninja Forms](https://ninjaforms.com/) is a user-friendly, drag-and-drop form builder for WordPress‚Äîbut like many form plugins, it's vulnerable to spam. If you're noticing spammy submissions from unknown sources, chances are they‚Äôre coming from IPs tied to VPN services or cloud hosting providers.

In this guide, we‚Äôll walk through why these IPs are a common spam source and how to block them manually or automatically using the OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin.

## **Why Block VPN and Cloud Provider IPs in Ninja Forms?**

Most spambots don't operate like average users. They rely on anonymous networks and high-powered servers to push spam through your site‚Äôs forms. This is especially true for Ninja Forms, which, by default, doesn‚Äôt block VPN or cloud-origin traffic.

Here‚Äôs why these sources are problematic:

* VPNs help spammers hide their true location and identity
* Cloud providers give them the infrastructure to send thousands of form entries at once
* Proxies allow bots to rotate IPs quickly to avoid detection

### **Blocking VPNs**

Turning on VPN blocking helps prevent submissions from people or bots trying to hide behind anonymizing tools like Tor or commercial VPN services. This is powerful, but keep in mind‚Äîsome genuine users (especially remote workers or privacy-first visitors) might also be using VPNs. So, apply this with your audience in mind.

### **Blocking Cloud Providers**

This method is more effective with minimal downsides. Most bots operate from data centers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Hetzner, etc.), not from everyday user networks. Blocking these IPs can dramatically cut down bot spam without affecting your legitimate visitors.

Regular spam filters only work if an IP is already flagged. By blocking IPs from VPNs and cloud hosts outright, you can proactively defend your Ninja Forms from emerging threats.

> Want to verify if an IP is from a VPN or server farm? Tools like **[IP Reputation Check](https://ipreputationcheck.com/)** can help you investigate.

## **Method 1: Manually Block VPN and Cloud IPs Using Cloudflare Firewall**

![Manually Block VPN and Cloud IPs Using Cloudflare Firewall](/blog/assets/posts/cloud-based-waf-security-web-application-firewall-cloudflare.png "Cloudflare ")

If you're using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to protect your site, you can set firewall rules to block traffic from known hosting providers and VPN networks.

### **How to Do It**

You'll need to target [ASNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (Autonomous System Numbers), which identify specific network operators‚Äîlike Google Cloud or Linode. If you identify that spam is coming from a particular provider, you can block that entire ASN.

**Example:** To block DigitalOcean traffic, you can block **ASN AS14061** via Cloudflare‚Äôs dashboard.

### **Limitations**

While effective, this method comes with trade-offs:

* **Ongoing upkeep:** ASNs change and new IPs get added frequently.
* **Risk of false positives:** Blocking entire networks might impact some legitimate users (especially VPN users or businesses using cloud infrastructure).
* **Time-intensive:** Requires identifying the source of spam, finding the correct ASN, and applying the rules manually.

Unless you‚Äôre a developer or running a high-volume site, this method can be a bit complex.

## **Method 2: Block VPN and Cloud IPs in Ninja Forms Using the OOPSpam Plugin (One-Click Setup)**

![OOPSpam WordPress plugin](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-overview.png "OOPSpam WordPress plugin")

Want something easier and more automated? The **[OOPSpam WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** (that‚Äôs us üëã) now supports Ninja Forms and gives you an instant [way to block spam](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-ninja-forms) from VPN and cloud sources.

We‚Äôve added two helpful toggles under the IP Filtering tab:

* Block VPNs
* Block Cloud Providers

Once enabled, these options will start filtering spam in your Ninja Forms submissions automatically‚Äîno IP research or ASN rules required.

## **Why OOPSpam Works for Ninja Forms**

OOPSpam uses a real-time database that tracks IP ranges from:

* Over 2,000+ cloud data centers
* Known VPN and proxy providers
* Reputation-based scoring and behavioral trends

This means your Ninja Forms are protected from both known and emerging threats. The plugin works silently in the background, offering high accuracy with low risk of blocking genuine users.

This same protection also applies to [OOPSpam‚Äôs API](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#introduction) and other plugin integrations.

Navigate to the **IP Filtering** tab in the plugin settings.
