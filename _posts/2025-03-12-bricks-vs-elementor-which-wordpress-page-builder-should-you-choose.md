## **Performance**

### **Bricks Performance**

![Bricks visual site builder homepage with a promotional banner.](/blog/assets/posts/bricks-visual-site-builder.png "Bricks Visual Site Builder for WordPress")

[Bricks](https://bricksbuilder.io/) is designed with performance in mind. It generates clean, minimal code, reducing bloat that can [slow down a website](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/slow-bricks-builder-website). Instead of relying on jQuery, Bricks uses vanilla JavaScript, which improves speed and efficiency.Â 

**Key points about Bricksâ€™ performance:**

* Clean HTML output with fewer unnecessary scripts
* No jQuery dependency, leading to faster load times
* Optimized for Core Web Vitals and SEO

### **Elementor Performance**

![Elementor homepage showcasing website building features.](/blog/assets/posts/elementor-website-builder.png "Elementor Website Builder")

[Elementor](https://elementor.com/) has made improvements in performance over the years, but it still loads more scripts and styles than Bricks. This can impact page speed, especially on content-heavy sites. However, features like lazy loading and improved asset loading have helped mitigate some of these issues.

**Key points about Elementorâ€™s performance:**

* Loads additional scripts that may [slow down page speed](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/slow-elementor-website)
* Includes performance optimization features like lazy loading
* Still heavier than Bricks in terms of code output

> **Verdict:** If speed is a priority, Bricks has the advantage.

## **Built-in Components**

### **Bricks Components**

![Account and archive elements for Bricks website builder.](/blog/assets/posts/bricks-builder-account.png "Bricks Builder Account and Archive Elements")

Bricks comes with [over 118 customizable elements](https://bricksbuilder.io/elements/), covering everything from basic text and images to more advanced features like dynamic content, custom loops, and WooCommerce components.

**Notable Bricks components:**

* Nestable elements for better design flexibility
* WooCommerce-specific elements for building online stores
* Dynamic content for advanced customization

### **Elementor Components**

![Elementor widget library displaying various design elements.](/blog/assets/posts/elementor-widget-library.png "Elementor Widget Library")

Elementor offers [over 100 widgets](https://elementor.com/widgets/), providing an extensive set of design elements. It also includes a massive template library, making it easy to create professional-looking sites quickly.

**Notable Elementor components:**

* Large library of ready-made templates
* Advanced widgets like animated headlines and pricing tables
* Integration with third-party add-ons for even more functionality

> **Verdict:** Both builders offer plenty of components, but Elementorâ€™s larger template library may be useful for beginners who want pre-designed layouts.

## **Form Builder Features**

### **Bricks Form Builder Features**

![Contact form with a customized email response preview.](/blog/assets/posts/contact-form-with-email.jpg "Contact Form with Email Customization")

Bricks allows users to create fully customizable forms with a drag-and-drop interface. You can add multiple field types, including text, email, checkboxes, and dropdowns. The builder gives you full control over form styling, meaning you can match the design to your website seamlessly.

However, [Bricks' form builder](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-bricks) has some limitations:

* It does not store form submissions natively, meaning youâ€™ll need to integrate with third-party plugins or services like Fluent Forms or WPForms to save responses.
* Flexible styling options to match your websiteâ€™s design.
* It allows custom webhooks, making it easier to send form data to external apps and automation tools.

> **Best for:** Developers and advanced users who want full control over form customization and are comfortable integrating third-party tools.

### **Elementor Form Builder Features**

![Elementor website builder interface showing a contact form design.](/blog/assets/posts/elementor-contact-form-design.png "Elementor Contact Form Design Interface")

[Elementorâ€™s form builder](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-elementor-forms) is more beginner-friendly and comes with several built-in features, including:

* Pre-designed form templates for faster setup.
* Field customization, allowing you to add text fields, number inputs, date pickers, and more.
* Conditional logic, which lets you show or hide form fields based on user selections.
* Form submission storage within Elementor Pro, meaning you donâ€™t need an external plugin to save responses.

Additionally, Elementor provides built-in integrations with popular email marketing platforms like Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, and HubSpot.

For spam protection, Elementor includes [reCAPTCHA V3](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3-which-is-right-for-your-website) and [hCaptcha](https://www.oopspam.com/hcaptcha-alternative), similar to Bricks. These tools help prevent automated spam but may not catch all unwanted submissions. For more advanced filtering, OOPSpam provides a more effective solution by analyzing form submissions and blocking spam.

> **Best for:** Users who want an easy-to-use form builder with built-in spam protection and marketing integrations.

### **Elementor Pricing**

![Elementor plugin pricing plans comparison.](/blog/assets/posts/elementor-pricing.png "Elementor Plugin Pricing Plans")
