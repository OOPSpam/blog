Automation is supposed to make life easier. You set up a Zap, connect your apps, and let the workflows run in the background while you focus on more important things.¬†

But then‚Äîbam!‚Äîspam sneaks in, filling your CRM with fake leads, triggering unnecessary email alerts, and messing up your carefully designed automations.

If you've been dealing with spam in [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), you're not alone. It‚Äôs a common problem, and the good news is, it‚Äôs fixable.¬†

In this guide, we‚Äôll go over five common spam problems you might encounter in Zapier and show you exactly [how to stop them](https://community.zapier.com/show-tell-5/how-to-stop-spam-in-your-zap-with-oopspam-46293)‚Äîusing OOPSpam and a few smart Zapier tricks.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

## **1. Spammy Contact Form Submissions That Trigger Unwanted Workflows**

![Zapier automation workflow filtering spam from Webflow form submissions.](/blog/assets/posts/overall-setup.png "Webflow Form Submission Spam Filter in Zapier")

### The Problem

You've connected [Typeform](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/typeform-form-spam), [Webflow](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/webflow-contactform-spam), or [Netlify](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/netlify-contactform-spam) to Zapier so that every form submission automatically feeds into your email, Slack, or CRM. The problem? Spammers love online forms and before you know it, your workflows are clogged with fake messages.

### **How It Happens**

* Bots scan websites for unprotected forms and flood them with junk.
* Your Zapier workflow doesn‚Äôt know the difference between real and fake submissions.
* Spam triggers actions like auto-replies, notifications, or CRM entries‚Äîwasting resources.

### **The Fix: Stop Spam at the Source**¬†

![OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin banner with tagline "Automate your Spam and Abuse Detection"](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-overview.png "OOPSpam Anti-Spam Plugin")

### **1. Filter out spam at the source with OOPSpam**

**[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/)** (that‚Äôs us! üëã) offers machine-learning spam detection that analyzes form submissions before they hit Zapier, keeping your workflows clean and efficient.

* **IP reputation checks** ‚Äì Blocks known spammers before they reach your forms.
* **Disposable email filtering** ‚Äì Prevents fake signups using temporary email addresses.
* **Spam score analysis** ‚Äì Detects common spam patterns to filter out bad submissions.

The best way to stop spam at the source is by using [OOPSpam WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) at the website level. We offer direct [integrations](https://www.oopspam.com/integrations/) with popular platforms like:

* **[WordPress](https://www.oopspam.com/wordpress)** ‚Äì Stop spam on contact forms, comment sections, and registrations.
* **[Bubble.io](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-bubble.io)** ‚Äì Seamlessly block spam submissions in your Bubble applications.
* **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?promo=oopspam-anti-spam-app-partner-program)** ‚Äì Automate spam filtering in workflows without coding.

> üí° **Don‚Äôt see the integration you need?** You can use [OOPSpam‚Äôs API](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#using-the-api-via-dashboard) to add spam filtering to any platform or custom-built solution!¬†

#### **2. Add the OOPSpam app in Zapier**

> Another option is to deal with spam entirely within Zapier. This approach works well if you prefer to manage everything in one platform without modifying your existing forms or website settings.

Before using Zapier‚Äôs built-in filters, you need to add [the OOPSpam app](https://zapier.com/apps/oopspam/integrations) to analyze your form submissions and return a spam score.

**Steps:**

1. In Zapier, **search for "OOPSpam"** and add it to your workflow.
2. Select the **"Check Spam Score"** action.
3. Map the form submission fields (e.g., email, message, IP address) to OOPSpam.
4. When a new form is submitted, OOPSpam will analyze it and return a spam score.

#### **3. Add a Zapier filter to block spammy submissions**

Now that OOPSpam provides a spam score, you can set up Zapier‚Äôs Filter tool to block unwanted submissions.

![Zapier filter step ensuring continuation only if submission is not spam.](/blog/assets/posts/filter-zapier.gif "Zapier Filter Setup for Spam Detection")

**Steps:**

1. After the OOPSpam action, add a **Filter by Zapier** step.
2. Set the filter to check if OOPSpam‚Äôs spam score is above your threshold.
3. Only allow form submissions that pass OOPSpam‚Äôs spam check to continue in the workflow.

## **2. Fake Leads Filling Up Your CRM**

![Zapier workflow automating HubSpot form submission with OOPSpam filtering and email sending.](/blog/assets/posts/overall-setup-1-.png "Zapier Automation for HubSpot Form with Spam Filtering")

### **The Problem**

Your CRM ([HubSpot](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/hubspot-contactform-spam), [Airtable](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/using-oopspam-to-filter-spam-submissions-in-airtable-forms-via-zapier), or Google Sheets) should store valuable customer data. Instead, it‚Äôs overflowing with fake names, bot-generated emails, and junk data.

### **How It Happens**

* Spambots use automated scripts to submit fake leads through forms.
* Some human spammers enter misleading information to test your system.
* Zapier blindly adds every submission to your CRM, whether it's legitimate or not.

### **The Fix: Validate Every Lead Before Storing It**

![Zapier workflow with a HubSpot form submission trigger, OOPSpam spam check, and conditional paths.](/blog/assets/posts/paths-zapier.png "Zapier Workflow with Conditional Paths")

#### **1. Use OOPSpam‚Äôs email and domain validation**¬†

With [OOPSpam‚Äôs Zapier app](https://zapier.com/apps/oopspam/integrations), you can automatically verify email addresses and check domain reputation before they enter your CRM. This ensures only legitimate leads move forward while blocking spam and disposable email providers.

OOPSpam detects temporary or disposable email domains (like Mailinator or 10MinuteMail) when the **"Block Disposable Emails"** setting is enabled. This prevents fake signups and keeps your database clean.

Here‚Äôs how OOPSpam helps within Zapier:

* Detects fake and temporary emails to prevent spammy signups.
* Filters out submissions from spammy IPs before they reach your system.
* Checks domain reputation to block emails from known disposable email providers.
* Assigns a spam score, helping you filter out junk before it triggers workflows.

#### **How to set it up in Zapier:**

![Zapier spam check setup with OOPSpam, blocking temporary emails.](/blog/assets/posts/filter-airtable-spam-zapier-02-25-2025_06_45_pm.png "OOPSpam Configuration in Zapier")

1. Add the **OOPSpam app** in your Zap.
2. Use **‚ÄúCheck Spam Score‚Äù** to analyze each submission.
3. Enable **"Block Disposable Emails"** in your OOPSpam settings.
4. Use a **Zapier filter** to stop flagged emails before they proceed.

Since everything happens within Zapier, it‚Äôs quick and seamless.

#### **3. Manually review flagged leads**

Not all flagged submissions are outright spam‚Äîsome may just be suspicious due to certain patterns. Instead of outright deleting them, you can store low-confidence leads in a separate spreadsheet for manual verification before taking action.

One effective approach is to **store all flagged entries in Google Sheets or Airtable** for later review. This way, you can periodically check if any legitimate leads were mistakenly flagged and take the necessary action.

![Airtable table displaying email submissions with spam scores.](/blog/assets/posts/filtered-submissions-table-in-airtable.png "Filtered Submissions Table in Airtable")

**How to do it in Zapier:**

1. Add Google Sheets or Airtable as the final destination in your Zapier workflow.
2. Use the "Create Spreadsheet Row" action to store spam-marked submissions in a separate tab.
3. Map OOPSpam‚Äôs spam score and other relevant data (email, IP, message content) to the sheet.
4. If you prefer to be alerted about legitimate leads, add an email notification step alongside the Google Sheets or Airtable¬† integration.

By doing this, you keep your CRM clean while having a **backup list** of questionable leads that you can check manually when needed.¬†

## **3. Spam in Google Forms and Other Data Collection Tools**

### **The Problem**

Your [Google Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/stopping-spam-submissions-in-google-forms-with-oopspam-and-zapier), Airtable, or Typeform is getting flooded with spam, polluting your data and ruining your reporting.

### **How It Happens**

* Public forms attract spambots, especially if they don‚Äôt require authentication.
* Spammers target open surveys, registration forms, and lead magnets.
* Zapier processes every response as if it‚Äôs legitimate.
* Your dataset becomes unusable with irrelevant or harmful content.

### **The Fix: Filter & Validate Google Forms Submissions**

![Zapier configuration for OOPSpam spam check with filtering options.](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-check-for-spam-configuration.png "OOPSpam Spam Check Setup in Zapier")

#### **1. Connect OOPSpam to your Zapier workflow**

Every time a form is submitted, OOPSpam analyzes it in real time. If the spam score is too high, the response is discarded before it reaches your workflow. This ensures only legitimate submissions continue.

#### **2. Enable response validation in Google Forms**

Google Forms offers **built-in validation** to reject obvious spam. You can require proper email formats, set character limits, or restrict specific words. This helps block bots before they submit fake entries.

#### **3. Use CAPTCHA sparingly**

Google [reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha) can stop automated spam, but too many CAPTCHAs can frustrate real users. Instead, combine CAPTCHA with OOPSpam‚Äôs filtering for a better balance between security and user experience.

## **4. Junk Email Notifications Flooding Your Inbox**

![Zapier workflow showing the setup for sending outbound emails using Email by Zapier.](/blog/assets/posts/sendemail-zapier.gif "Sending Outbound Emails in Zapier")

### **The Problem**

You‚Äôve set up Zapier email alerts for form submissions or CRM updates but now your inbox is overflowing with spam-triggered notifications.

### **How It Happens**

* Spam submissions in your form trigger an email every time.
* Zapier forwards every submission without filtering, cluttering your inbox.
* Important emails get lost in the mess.

### **The Fix: Only Send Alerts for Legitimate Submissions**

Many platforms like Google Forms, HubSpot, and Webflow have built-in email notifications that send alerts for every form submission‚Äîeven spam. **Disable these notifications and use Zapier + OOPSpam to send only filtered, legitimate alerts.**

#### **1. Use OOPSpam to pre-filter messages**

Before Zapier sends an email, run the submission through OOPSpam‚Äôs Zapier app. OOPSpam checks the spam score and blocks junk messages before they trigger notifications.

üí° For platforms without an OOPSpam plugin, use the [OOPSpam API](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#introduction) to filter spam before it starts an automation.

#### **2. Add a conditional Zapier filter**

Once OOPSpam returns a spam score, add a Zapier filter to control email notifications. Set it to only send alerts if the spam score is below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 3). This ensures you receive only genuine submissions.

#### **3. Create a summary email instead of individual notifications**

Use [Zapier‚Äôs Digest](https://zapier.com/apps/digest/integrations) feature to send a summary of clean submissions at set intervals instead of an email for each one.

## **5. Malicious Spam Containing Phishing Links & Harmful Content**

![Zapier workflow showing the OOPSpam integration for spam detection.](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-oopspam.gif "OOPSpam Spam Detection in Zapier")

### **The Problem**

Some spam is more than just annoying‚Äîit‚Äôs dangerous. If spammers sneak phishing links into your workflows, users might click on them, leading to data breaches or malware attacks.

### **How It Happens**

* Spammers embed malicious URLs in form fields or chatbots.
* Zapier passes the data through without checking.
* Employees or customers accidentally click a phishing link in an email or Slack notification, leading to data breaches.

### **The Fix: Block Suspicious Links Before They Spread**

#### **1. Enable OOPSpam‚Äôs domain reputation check**

OOPSpam scans submitted URLs for known phishing links or flagged domains. If a malicious link is detected, Zapier can stop the workflow immediately.

#### **2. Set up keyword-based filters in Zapier**

OOPSpam flags submissions containing common spam words like "reset password," "urgent," or "click here"‚Äîphrases often used in phishing attacks.

To enhance security, use a Zapier filter alongside OOPSpam. Once OOPSpam detects suspicious language, set Zapier to block messages with a high spam score. This prevents phishing emails from reaching your inbox, CRM, or triggering unwanted automations.¬†

#### **3. Monitor flagged entries manually**

Keep a log of suspicious messages for review before they reach users.

## **Final Thoughts**

Zapier automation should make your life easier, not drown you in spam. And spam doesn‚Äôt just clutter your workflow‚Äîit wastes resources, skews your data, and can even pose security risks.

The best way to fight back? Use [OOPSpam + Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/oopspam/integrations) filters to screen every submission before it enters your automation.
