### **Can WPDiscuz Block Countries on Its Own?**

No. [WPDiscuz](https://wpdiscuz.com/) focuses on user engagement, threaded comments, and voting, not security filtering. If spam or abusive comments are coming from certain regions, youâ€™ll need to add tools like [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) or Cloudflare.

## **Whatâ€™s the Easiest Way to Block Spam Comments by Country?**

Use [OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) (thatâ€™s us ðŸ‘‹). It integrates directly with WordPress and adds country-level filtering to your comment forms.

### **How to Set It Up**

Install and activate the **OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin**. Sign up at **[OOPSpam.com](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login)** to get your API key.

In WordPress, go to **Settings > OOPSpam Anti-Spam** and paste the key.

Enable [spam protection for **WPDiscuz**](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-wpdiscuz)forms.

Use the **Country Filtering** under the **General Settings** tab in OOPSpam to select which countries to block or allow.

Save and review results in **Spam & Ham logs** inside WordPress.

For more detailed tracking, you can also use the **OOPSpam Dashboard**, where youâ€™ll find filtering reports, reasons for blocking, and patterns over time.

With this, only real comments from allowed regions will appear.

### **What OOPSpam Can Do**

* Block or allow comments by country.
* Stop unwanted text with language filtering.
* Limit abuse with [submission frequency](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) controls.
* Detect bots with machine learning-powered spam checks.
* Block VPN, proxy, and TOR traffic.
* Provide [submission logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/) for transparency.

## **What If I Want to Block Entire Countries from My Website?**

Thatâ€™s where [Cloudflare Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/) comes in. Instead of just filtering WPDiscuz comments, Cloudflare blocks visitors from chosen [countries](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/common-cloudflare-turnstile-errors-in-wordpress-forms-and-how-to-fix-them) before they even load your site.

### **Cloudflare Setup in 5 Steps**

![Block Entire Countries from My Website using Cloudflare ](/blog/assets/posts/blocking-countries-in-cloudflare.png "Block Entire Countries from My Website using Cloudflare ")

1. [Log in](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) to **Cloudflare**.
2. Go to **Security > WAF > Firewall Rules**.
3. Create a new rule called â€˜**Block Countriesâ€™**.
4. Set the field to **Country**, operator **is in**, then select the countries.
5. Choose **Block** as the action and save.

Now, all traffic from those countries will be stopped at the network level.

## **Which Option Should You Choose?**

* **OOPSpam** - Best for keeping WPDiscuz comments clean without blocking access to your site.
* **Cloudflare** -Â  Best for stopping broader attacks or when abusive traffic is overwhelming.

WPDiscuz doesnâ€™t replace security tools, it enhances discussions. Pairing it with OOPSpam gives you comment-level protection. Adding Cloudflare gives you site-wide blocking. Together, they keep your community open to real voices while shutting out spam and abuse.
