[Toolset Forms](https://toolset.com/home/cred/) does not include built-in country blocking. To stop spam or unwanted traffic, you need two options:

1. Use [OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) (that‚Äôs us üëã) for form-level filtering.
2. Use [Cloudflare Firewall Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/) to block entire countries at the network level.

## **Option 1: Block Countries in Toolset Forms with OOPSpam**

OOPSpam Anti-Spam integrates with WordPress and adds country and language filtering to your forms. It prevents unwanted submissions while letting legitimate users through.

### **Key Features for Toolset Forms**

* Block or allow submissions from specific countries.
* Filter entries written in unwanted languages.
* [Limit form submissions](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) to reduce spam and misuse.
* Detect spam with machine learning and stop bots, proxies, VPNs, and TOR users.
* Review blocked and approved entries with clear logs.

### **How to Set It Up**

Install the OOPSpam plugin from **Plugins > Add New** in WordPress. Create an account at [OOPSpam.com](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login) and generate an API key.

Paste the API key into **OOPSpam Anti-Spam > Settings**.

Enable protection for **Toolset Forms** in the plugin settings.

Go to **Country Filtering** and choose whether to block certain countries or allow only specific ones.

### **Reviewing Entries**

Blocked and approved submissions appear in two places: inside WordPress under the Spam & Ham [logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/):

and in your OOPSpam Dashboard with more detailed filtering reports:

This transparency lets you fine-tune settings and recover valid leads if needed.

## **Option 2: Block Entire Countries with Cloudflare**

If the problem goes beyond form spam, such as [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/), scraping, or server overload, block traffic at the network level with Cloudflare.

### **How to Do It**

![Block Entire Countries with Cloudflare](/blog/assets/posts/blocking-countries-in-cloudflare.png "Block Entire Countries with Cloudflare")

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) account.
2. Go to **Security > WAF > Firewall Rules**.
3. Create a new rule and name it ‚ÄúBlock Countries.‚Äù
4. Set the field to **Country**, operator to **is in**, and choose the countries you want to block.
5. Set the action to **Block** and save.

Cloudflare will now block all visitors from those countries before they ever reach your site.

## **Which Method Should You Choose?**

* Use **OOPSpam** if you want precision ‚Äî block only form submissions while leaving the rest of your site accessible.
* Use **Cloudflare Firewall** if you need to block all access from a region for security, compliance, or server performance.

## **Final thoughts**

Toolset Forms does not have built-in country blocking. But with [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/), you can filter submissions by region and keep your forms clean. For stronger protection, layer Cloudflare Firewall rules to block entire countries at the network level.

This combination gives you control, flexibility, and security,¬† without disrupting legitimate visitors.
