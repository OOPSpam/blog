Collecting form submissions through Jotform is a simple way to gather leads and feedback‚Äîbut it also opens the door to spam. Unwanted entries from bots and fake users can disrupt your workflow, flood your inbox, and reduce the accuracy of your data.

To avoid this, you can use Zapier and [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) to automatically filter out spam from [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/) submissions. In this blog, we‚Äôll show you how to stop spam on Jotform using this integration, how each step works, and how to customize the setup to fit your needs.

## **How to Stop Spam on Jotform Using Zapier and OOPSpam**

![How to Stop Spam on Jotform Using Zapier and OOPSpam](/blog/assets/posts/stop-spam-on-jotform-using-zapier-and-oopspam.png "How to Stop Spam on Jotform Using Zapier and OOPSpam")

Below is a simple 5-step setup using Zapier. You can use the[ Zapier integration template here](https://zapier.com/apps/email/integrations/jotform/1211782/check-new-jotform-submissions-for-spam-with-oopspam-and-send-outbound-emails) or build it manually.¬†

To set up automated spam filtering for your Jotform submissions, you'll need a Jotform account, an [OOPSpam API key](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#introduction), and a Zapier (or [Make.com](http://make.com)) account. This setup will filter out spam before you receive notifications or store the data.

### **Step 1: Disable Default Email Notifications in Jotform**

![Disable Default Email Notifications in Jotform](/blog/assets/posts/disable-email-notification-jotform.png "Disable Default Email Notifications in Jotform")

Before starting with Zapier, go to your Jotform settings and **turn off the default email notifications** for the form you‚Äôre working with. This avoids duplicate emails and gives Zapier full control over which submissions trigger actions.

### **Step 2: Create a Zap and Set the Trigger to ‚ÄúNew Submission‚Äù in Jotform**

![Create a Zap and Set the Trigger to ‚ÄúNew Submission‚Äù in Jotform](/blog/assets/posts/set-the-trigger-to-new-submission-in-jotform.png "Create a Zap and Set the Trigger to ‚ÄúNew Submission‚Äù in Jotform")

In [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), start by creating a new Zap.

* Choose **Jotform** as the trigger app.
* Set the trigger event to **New Submission**.
* Connect your Jotform account and select the form you want to monitor.

This will start the workflow each time a user submits your form.

### **Step 3: Add OOPSpam to Check for Spam**

![Add OOPSpam to Check for Spam](/blog/assets/posts/check-for-spam.png "Add OOPSpam to Check for Spam")

Add **[OOPSpam](https://zapier.com/apps/oopspam/integrations)** as the next step. Choose the action **‚ÄúCheck for Spam.‚Äù** You‚Äôll need to map your Jotform fields (like email, name, content) into the OOPSpam fields. OOPSpam will return a spam score and other information.

#### **Additional Settings You Can Configure**

Below the basic fields, OOPSpam provides several additional options to help you fine-tune your spam filtering:

* **Consider short messages as spam** ‚Äì Flags very short or generic messages.
* **Log submissions to OOPSpam** ‚Äì Enable if you want to keep logs for analysis.
* **Block temporary/disposable emails** ‚Äì Filters out emails from throwaway domains.
* **Block IP addresses from Cloud Providers** ‚Äì Stops submissions from cloud-based bots.
* **Block IP addresses from VPN Providers** ‚Äì Blocks entries [sent through VPNs](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-block-ips-from-vpn-and-cloud-providers-in-zapier).
* **Language Allowlist** ‚Äì Accepts submissions [only in selected languages](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-automatically-block-spam-form-submissions-in-zapier-based-on-language).
* **Allow entries only from these countries** ‚Äì Accepts submissions from specific countries.

Once these settings are configured to match your needs, click **Continue** to move on to the filter step.

### **Step 4: Filter the Results Based on Spam Score**

![Filter the Results Based on Spam Score](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-filter-condition-setup.png "Filter the Results Based on Spam Score")

Use Zapier‚Äôs [Filter](https://zapier.com/blog/filter-by-zapier-guide/) step to decide whether the submission should continue. For example, you can set the filter to continue only if the spam score is **less than 3**. This stops spam submissions from going further in the workflow.

#### **üí° Spam Score Threshold**

For most use cases:

* **Score 0‚Äì2** = Not spam
* **Score 3‚Äì6** = Likely spam

You can adjust this threshold if needed, but this range works well in most setups. Review OOPSpam logs occasionally to fine-tune if necessary.

### **Step 5: Send a Notification or Store the Clean Submission**

Once the form entry passes the spam filter, decide what to do with it:

* **Send an email** ‚Äì Use Zapier Email, Gmail, or Outlook to notify yourself or your team.
* **Store the data** ‚Äì Send clean submissions to a Google Sheet, CRM, Slack, or another app.
* **Trigger another workflow** ‚Äì Add follow-up actions like tagging in a database or initiating onboarding.

## **Why Use This Integration?**

This Jotform, Zapier, and OOPSpam setup works well because:

* **No user friction** ‚Äì No captchas or puzzles for your visitors
* **Low maintenance** ‚Äì Once set up, it runs in the background
* **Customizable** ‚Äì Works with any Jotform and any follow-up action
* **Better data** ‚Äì Fewer junk entries in your CRM or reports

## **Final thoughts**

Setting up [spam protection for Jotform](https://www.oopspam.com/integrations/spam-protection-for-jotform) doesn‚Äôt require complex code or manual review. With Zapier and OOPSpam, you can automate the process and ensure that only clean submissions make it through.
