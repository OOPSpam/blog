If you automate form submissions through Make (formerly Integromat), you might still notice off-topic or irrelevant messages slipping through‚Äîeven with filters in place. Why? Most form apps integrated with Make don‚Äôt transmit user metadata like IP addresses, making traditional spam filters less effective.

That‚Äôs where contextual spam detection steps in. With [OOPSpam‚Äôs Context-Aware Spam Detection](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/introducing-contextual-spam-detection), you can block messages that simply don‚Äôt match the purpose of your form or business.

## **What is Contextual Spam Detection?**

![Contextual Spam Detection](/blog/assets/posts/jotform-make.png "Contextual Spam Detection")

Contextual spam detection works differently from IP- or email-based filters. Instead of evaluating who sent the message, it evaluates what the message says and why it's likely being sent.

Let‚Äôs say someone submits a form through Make mentioning "forex signals" on your event photography booking form. Contextual detection sees the mismatch between the message content and your form‚Äôs purpose, and flags it.

You should consider using this when:

* Your [Make](https://www.make.com/en) forms don‚Äôt pass IP, email, or user agent metadata
* The message *looks* legitimate but doesn't make sense in context
* You need a privacy-friendly alternative to traditional spam filters

> **Note**: Contextual detection doesn‚Äôt replace your current filters. It complements them‚Äîespecially when you have limited sender data.

This approach is especially valuable in automation platforms like [Make](https://www.make.com/en/blog/automate-spam-free-customer-interactions-oopspam) and [Zapier](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/stop-off-topic-submissions-in-zapier-using-contextual-spam-detection), where form submitter details such as IP addresses aren't typically transmitted. In these situations, relying on message content and business context becomes the most effective way to detect and block irrelevant submissions.

## **How to Use Contextual Spam Detection in Make**

We‚Äôll show you how to [integrate OOPSpam with Make](https://help.oopspam.com/other-integrations/make/) to filter out off-topic or misleading form messages.

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Form Module**

Start with a form submission trigger. For example, use [Jotform](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/stop-spam-on-jotform-using-zapier-and-oopspam) or [Typeform](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/typeform-form-spam) as your starting module.

![Set Up Your Jotform Module](/blog/assets/posts/jotform-submissions.png "Set Up Your Jotform Module")

**Module:** `Watch Submissions` (e.g., Jotform)

This module will pull in every new submission as a bundle of data.

### **Step 2: Add the OOPSpam Module**

After your form trigger, add the ‚Äú**Check for Spam**‚Äù module from **OOPSpam Anti-Spam** (that‚Äôs us! üëã).

![Add the OOPSpam Module](/blog/assets/posts/add-the-oopspam-module-make.png "Add the OOPSpam Module")

This is a verified module on Make and makes integration fast and straightforward.

![OOPSpam Anti-Spam - Context Settings](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-context.png "OOPSpam Anti-Spam - Context Settings")

You‚Äôll need to map:

* **Content**: The actual message or submission content
* **Context**: A sentence describing your business or form's purpose (2-3 sentences max)

The machine learning will match the message to your context and return a spam score. The better your context, the more accurate the detection.

### **Step 3: Define Your Context**

This is where the smart filtering happens. Your **context** helps OOPSpam understand what kind of messages are appropriate.

![Define Your Context](/blog/assets/posts/define-your-context-make.png "Define Your Context")

Here are a few examples:

* "We provide eco-friendly baby products through our WooCommerce site."
* "This site is used to collect service requests for HVAC repairs in Texas."
* "Our agency builds custom Shopify websites for e-commerce brands."

### **Step 4: Add a Router or Filter Module (Optional)**

Now that OOPSpam returns a **spam score**, you‚Äôll want to filter your data to route only the clean messages through your workflow‚Äîand isolate the spam.

In [Make](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/5-common-spam-problems-in-make-how-to-fix-them), this is done using a **Router module** with two paths:

#### **Non-Spam Submissions Route**

For legitimate messages, use a filter condition that allows only low spam scores to continue.

![Non-Spam Submissions Route](/blog/assets/posts/non-spam-submissions-route-make.png "Non-Spam Submissions Route")

**Condition:** `Spam Score < 3`

Label this filter **‚ÄúNon-Spam Submissions‚Äù** and connect it to your desired module (e.g. Google Sheets, email, CRM, etc.).

#### **Spam Submissions Route**

Create a second filter route to handle or discard high-scoring spam messages.

![Spam Submissions Route](/blog/assets/posts/spam-submissions-route-make.png "Spam Submissions Route")

**Condition:** `Spam Score > 3`

Label this route **‚ÄúSpam Submissions.‚Äù** You can choose to:

* Log the message for manual review
* Send it to a separate spreadsheet
* Ignore it completely (no connection beyond this point)

This dual-routing method gives you full control over how each message is handled‚Äîkeeping your workflow clean and spam-free without losing visibility into what‚Äôs being filtered.

## **Supported Platforms**

OOPSpam‚Äôs Contextual Spam Detection is available via:

* [Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?promo=oopspam-anti-spam-app-partner-program) (as shown above)

## **Final Thoughts**

If you're tired of unwanted form entries making their way into your Make automations, this approach provides an intelligent and lightweight solution.

Contextual spam detection is especially useful in Make, since most form tools don‚Äôt provide rich sender metadata. With just your message and a clear context, you can keep your workflows clean and relevant.
