Seeing unwanted or spam submissions from certain countries through your [Kadence Forms](https://www.kadencewp.com/)? While Kadence Blocks offers a flexible form builder, it currently does not include built-in support for blocking submissions by country. The form block doesn‚Äôt provide IP-based or geo-location filtering natively.

That said, you can still manage this with the right tools. By integrating with a plugin like [OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) (that‚Äôs us üëã), you can enable country-level filtering for your forms. For broader protection, you can also apply server-level country blocks using Cloudflare.

### **No Built-In Country Blocking in Kadence Forms**

Kadence Forms are part of the [Kadence Blocks](https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-blocks/) plugin suite, offering lightweight yet functional form-building capabilities. However, as of now, there‚Äôs no native setting to filter or restrict form entries by country, IP, or language.

That means you‚Äôll need to turn to an external solution to [block spam](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-kadence-form) and filter submissions from specific regions. Let‚Äôs explore how to do that using [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) and Cloudflare.

## **1. Block Countries in Kadence Forms Using OOPSpam**

If you‚Äôre getting spam submissions, especially from specific countries, OOPSpam Anti-Spam is the easiest way to fix it. This plugin offers advanced spam filtering and integrates smoothly with Kadence Forms.

It doesn‚Äôt require you to modify your forms, add hidden fields, or write code. Once installed, you just toggle Kadence Forms protection on, select which countries to block, and you‚Äôre done!

### **What OOPSpam Adds to Kadence Forms**

* **Spam Scoring with Machine Learning**‚Äì Detects patterns of spam using behavior-based filtering

* **Rate Limiting** ‚Äì Prevents abusive [repeated submissions](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam)

Your forms will now be protected automatically, no manual adjustments needed per form.

### **Reviewing Blocked Entries**

OOPSpam gives you access to detailed submission [logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/), allowing you to:

* View spam scores
* See timestamps and IP addresses
* Identify which country the submission came from
* Understand why it was blocked

These logs are visible in both your WordPress dashboard 

![WordPress dashboard](/blog/assets/posts/form-spam-entries-oopspam.png "WordPress dashboard")

and the OOPSpam online dashboard.

## **2. Block Countries Entirely Using Cloudflare**

If you're seeing issues beyond form spam, like [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/), brute-force login attempts, or scraper bots, you may want to block entire countries from accessing your website.

This method is handled via your CDN or hosting firewall, such as [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

> This blocks all traffic from selected countries, not just form submissions.

### **How to Block Countries with Cloudflare**

![How to Block Countries with Cloudflare](/blog/assets/posts/blocking-countries-in-cloudflare.png "How to Block Countries with Cloudflare")

**Step 1: Log In to Cloudflare**

Visit [Cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), log in, and select your domain.

**Step 2: Create a Firewall Rule**

1. Navigate to **Security > WAF > Firewall Rules**
2. Click **Create Firewall Rule**
3. Name your rule (e.g., ‚ÄúBlock Countries‚Äù)
4. Set these conditions:

   * **Field:** Country
   * **Operator:** is in
   * **Value:** Select the countries you want to block
5. Action: **Block**
6. Save the rule

Once saved, users from the [blocked countries](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/blocking-countries-from-accessing-your-website-using-cloudflare) will be fully restricted from accessing any part of your site, including Kadence Forms.

### **When to Use This Method**

* You‚Äôre under attack from a specific region
* You need to comply with regional restrictions
* You want to reduce server load from low-quality traffic sources

## **Final thoughts**

Kadence Forms don‚Äôt have a built-in way to block countries. OOPSpam Anti-Spam fills the gap by offering advanced spam filtering, country and language blocking, and detailed logs, all without altering your forms.¬†

For broader protection, Cloudflare lets you block entire regions from reaching your site altogether. Together, they give you the flexibility to filter traffic and protect your forms from abuse, without sacrificing legitimate engagement.
