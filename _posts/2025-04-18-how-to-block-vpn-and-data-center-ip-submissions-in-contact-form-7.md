[Contact Form 7](https://contactform7.com/) is one of the most widely used WordPress form plugins‚Äîbut it's also a common target for spambots. If you‚Äôve been receiving spammy submissions, especially from anonymous or suspicious sources, it‚Äôs likely due to VPNs and cloud-hosted servers.

In this guide, we‚Äôll show you how to block spam from these sources‚Äîeither manually via Cloudflare or automatically using the OOPSpam WordPress plugin.

## **Why Block VPN and Cloud Provider IPs in Contact Form 7?**

Most spambots rely on cloud services and VPNs to automate attacks and avoid detection. Here‚Äôs how they get around basic spam filters:

* VPNs allow them to mask their IP and location
* Proxies rotate their identities rapidly
* Cloud servers like AWS or DigitalOcean give them the power to send large volumes of spam

### **Blocking VPNs**

Turning on VPN blocking helps you stop form submissions from users hiding behind tools like Tor or commercial VPNs. Keep in mind that some legitimate visitors might also use VPNs for privacy or remote work. So, this setting is powerful but should be used thoughtfully.

### **Blocking Cloud Providers**

This is a safer and more effective method. Most automated spam comes from cloud infrastructure, not from real people. Blocking IPs from data centers ensures your Contact Form 7 forms aren't flooded by bots using hosting platforms like Google Cloud, OVH, or Linode.

Spam plugins usually rely on previous data to flag suspicious IPs‚Äîbut by blocking VPN and data center traffic at the source, you get ahead of new threats *before* they start.

> Not sure about a certain IP? Tools like **[IP Reputation Check](https://ipreputationcheck.com/)** can help confirm whether it belongs to a VPN or data center.

## **Method 1: Manually Block VPN and Cloud IPs Using Cloudflare Firewall**

If your website is connected to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can manually block traffic from certain networks using ASN-based rules.

### **How to Do It**

[ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (Autonomous System Numbers) are unique IDs assigned to hosting providers and network operators. You can block all traffic from known spammy networks by entering their ASN into Cloudflare‚Äôs firewall rules.

**Example:** To block spam from DigitalOcean, use ASN **AS14061** in Cloudflare‚Äôs settings.

### **Pros & Cons**

**Pros:**

* Offers powerful control over traffic sources
* Blocks spam before it reaches your server

**Cons:**

* ASNs and IPs frequently change, requiring regular maintenance
* May block legitimate users (especially those on business VPNs or remote cloud setups)
* Requires some technical know-how and time

This method is better suited for developers or high-traffic websites with IT support.

## **Method 2: Block VPN and Cloud IPs in Contact Form 7 with OOPSpam**

![Use the OOPSpam WordPress plugin](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-overview.png "OOPSpam WordPress plugin")

For a faster and easier solution, use the **[OOPSpam WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** (that‚Äôs us üëã), which works seamlessly with Contact Form 7.

It now includes two powerful toggles under the IP Filtering settings:

* Block VPNs
* Block Cloud Providers

With just a click, you can reduce spam from the most common sources‚Äîno manual filters or firewall rules required.

## **Why OOPSpam Is Ideal for Contact Form 7 Users**

The plugin doesn‚Äôt just rely on spam history‚Äîit uses a live, constantly updated database of:

* 2,000+ data center IP ranges
* Known VPN and proxy IPs
* Realtime reputation scoring based on current behavior

This ensures your Contact Form 7 submissions are protected 24/7, without adding extra plugins or custom code.

And if you're using the [OOPSpam API](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#introduction) or have other forms in use, these protections apply there too.

## **How to Set Up VPN and Cloud IP Blocking with OOPSpam for Contact Form 7**

### **Step 1: Install the Plugin**

Head to your WordPress dashboard and install **[OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://www.oopspam.com/wordpress)** from the plugin directory.

There you‚Äôll see two key options:

Switch these on based on your needs, and click **Save Changes**. That‚Äôs it‚Äîyour Contact Form 7 forms are now protected with IP-based spam filtering.

## **Tips for Effective Spam Protection in Contact Form 7**
