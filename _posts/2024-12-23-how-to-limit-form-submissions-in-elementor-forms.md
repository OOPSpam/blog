Forms are essential in connecting with your audience, whether you're collecting feedback, managing registrations, or capturing leads. However, they can sometimes attract spam and abuse, making it harder to focus on genuine submissions. Fake entries and bot attacks can disrupt your workflow and affect your site's performance.

If you use [Elementor Forms](https://elementor.com/pages/form-builder/), you know how easy it is to create beautiful and functional forms. But keeping them secure from excessive or harmful submissions often requires additional tools. That’s where OOPSpam can help by adding advanced rate-limiting and anti-spam features.

In this post, we’ll guide you through using OOPSpam’s rate-limiting functionality to protect your forms while maintaining a positive experience for real users.

## What Is Rate Limiting, and Why Does It Matter?

[Rate limiting](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) works like a gatekeeper for your forms. It controls how frequently a user can submit a form within a defined period. 

For example, you might allow only five submissions per hour to deter spam while catering to authentic users.

### Why Rate Limiting Is Critical

Spam submissions can lead to significant issues:

* **Server Overload:** High submission rates can slow down or crash your website.
* **Compromised Data Integrity:** Spam makes it harder to analyze genuine submissions.
* **User Frustration:** Legitimate users may encounter delays or blocked access due to malicious activity.

Implementing rate limiting ensures your forms remain secure, your data stays clean, and your users enjoy a smooth experience.

## The Common Challenges of Elementor Forms Without Rate Limiting

Elementor Forms is a powerful tool for building forms, but like many form builders, its default spam protection features have limitations. Without additional protections such as rate limiting, you might face:

* **Spam Submissions:** Bots can flood your forms with hundreds of entries in minutes.
* **Duplicate Submissions:** Users might accidentally click “Submit” multiple times, cluttering your data.
* **Brute Force Attacks:** Hackers might target login or registration forms with repeated attempts to guess credentials.

According to our 2024 annual spam report, Elementor Forms is the third most targeted form builder, accounting for [19.7% of spam attacks](https://www.oopspam.com/2024-spam-report). This statistic highlights the importance of robust protections. 

Considering that bots account for [over 40%](https://futurecio.tech/bots-compose-42-of-overall-web-traffic-study-finds/) of internet traffic and WordPress sites are prime targets for spam, using advanced tools like OOPSpam is crucial to mitigate these risks.
