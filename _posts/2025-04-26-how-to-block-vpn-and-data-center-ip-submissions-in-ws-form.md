[WS Form](https://wsform.com/) is a powerhouse when it comes to building complex, dynamic forms in WordPress. But no matter how advanced your setup is, spam can still sneak throughâ€”especially when bots are using VPNs and cloud-hosted servers to submit junk entries.

This guide will walk you through why blocking these traffic sources matters for WS Form, and show you two effective ways to do itâ€”manually through Cloudflare or automatically using the OOPSpam plugin.

## **Why VPN and Cloud Provider IPs Are a Problem for WS Form Users**

Spambots have gotten more sophisticated. They donâ€™t just try to submit gibberish text anymoreâ€”they now:

* Use [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) to hide their IPs and bypass country blocks
* Leverage proxies to rotate identities and stay undetected
* Operate through cloud platforms (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) to automate submissions across thousands of sites

These tactics let them bypass even some of WS Formâ€™s built-in protections.

### **Blocking VPNs**

Blocking VPN IPs stops spam from anonymized networks like Tor or commercial VPN providers. However, youâ€™ll want to consider your audienceâ€”some legitimate users may also rely on VPNs for privacy or access.

### **Blocking Cloud Provider IPs**

This is where you get the biggest impact. Most spam submissions donâ€™t come from individualsâ€”they come from data center IPs tied to bot servers. Blocking this traffic is generally safe and highly effective.

While most anti-spam tools look for behavior or content patterns, IP-based blocking proactively filters submissions before they even reach your WS Form.

> Need help checking if an IP is from a VPN or data center? Use tools like **[IP Reputation Check](https://ipreputationcheck.com/)** to investigate.

## **Method 1: Block VPN and Cloud IPs Manually Using Cloudflare**

![Cloudflare WAF](/blog/assets/posts/cloud-based-waf-security-web-application-firewall-cloudflare.png "Cloudflare")

If youâ€™re running your WordPress site through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can manually configure firewall rules to block traffic from known networks.

### **How It Works**

Each network provider has an [ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (Autonomous System Number), a unique identifier you can use in Cloudflare to block all traffic from that network.

![Block ASN in your Cloudflare firewall settings](/blog/assets/posts/cloudflare_was_asn.png "Block ASN in your Cloudflare firewall settings")

**Example:** If you discover repeated spam from DigitalOcean servers, you can block **ASN AS14061** in your Cloudflare firewall settings.

### **What to Watch Out For**

* **Ongoing maintenance:** ASNs and IP blocks change frequently
* **Potential false positives:** You could unintentionally block real users, especially business users on cloud-hosted systems
* **Time-consuming setup:** Youâ€™ll need to research ASNs, identify spam sources, and manually configure rules

This approach is powerful but best suited for technically advanced users managing large or high-risk websites.

## **Method 2: Automatically Block VPN and Cloud IPs in WS Form with OOPSpam**

![OOPSpam WordPress plugin](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-overview.png "OOPSpam WordPress plugin")

If you want something more automated and beginner-friendly, the **[OOPSpam WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** (thatâ€™s us ðŸ‘‹) is a fantastic solution. It works seamlessly with WS Form and only takes a few clicks to get started.

OOPSpam now includes two toggles under IP Filtering:

* Block VPNs
* Block Cloud Providers

Once these are enabled, the plugin filters out spam before it even reaches your WS Form entries.

### **Why OOPSpam Is an Ideal Match for WS Form**

Unlike basic honeypot or [CAPTCHA](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/best-captcha-alternatives) setups, OOPSpam connects to a real-time, constantly updated threat database that includes:

* IPs from over 2,000 cloud infrastructure providers
* Known VPN and proxy networks
* Threat signals and reputation scoring updated continuously

That means it not only stops known spam IPs, but also blocks emerging threats that havenâ€™t yet made it to blocklists.

OOPSpam is lightweight, privacy-focused, and compatible with WS Formâ€™s powerful features without affecting performance.

## **How to Enable VPN and Cloud IP Blocking in WS Form Using OOPSpam**

![Install the Plugin](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-dashboard-api.png "Install the Plugin")

### **Step 1: Install the Plugin**

* Go to your WordPress dashboard
* Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**
* Search for **OOPSpam Anti-Spam**, install and activate it

Then head over to[ OOPSpam Dashboard](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login) to create a free account and copy your API key.

### **Step 2: Connect Your API Key**

![Connect Your API Key](/blog/assets/posts/my-api-key-field.png "Connect Your API Key")

* Go to **Settings > OOPSpam Anti-Spam**
* In the **General** tab, choose **OOPSpam Dashboard** as your source
* Paste your API key into the **My API Key** field

Once WS Form is installed, spam protection settings will become available.

![Activate Spam Protection option for WS Form](/blog/assets/posts/activate-ws-form.png "Activate Spam Protection option for WS Form")

* Turn **ON** the Activate Spam Protection option to filter unwanted submissions.
* You can also write a message that will be shown when a submission is marked as spam.

### **Step 3: Enable IP Filtering**

Switch to the **IP Filtering** tab and turn on:

* **Block VPNs** â€“ Use with caution if you have international or privacy-conscious users
* **Block Cloud Providers** â€“ Strongly recommended for eliminating bot-based spam

Click **Save Changes** and you're all set. No additional WS Form configuration is neededâ€”OOPSpam filters traffic automatically in the background.

## **Tips for Getting the Best Results with WS Form**

* **Check submissions regularly:** Monitor your spam folder for false positives
* **Layer your defenses:** Use OOPSpam alongside WS Formâ€™s own validation rules or custom logic
* **Explore additional OOPSpam features**:
* * Country-based filtering

  * [Rate limiting](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-limit-form-submissions-in-ws-form)

  * Language-based blocking

  * Keyword-based spam scoring

These tools help you create a smarter, more targeted defense against spam.

## **Final Thoughts**

WS Form gives you full control over form design and logicâ€”but that power means little if your forms are getting hammered with junk submissions.

By blocking traffic from VPNs and cloud data centers, you shut down the most common entry points for spamâ€”before it even hits your inbox. The OOPSpam plugin gives you this power with almost no setup time.
