### **The Problem: QuForm Doesnâ€™t Block Countries**

Out of the box, [QuForm](https://www.quform.com/) doesnâ€™t give you a way to block submissions by country. Its focus is on building custom, flexible formsâ€”not stopping bad traffic.

That means if spam or abuse is coming from specific regions, youâ€™ll need to add another layer of protection.

## **The Quick Fix: OOPSpam Anti-Spam**

[OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) (thatâ€™s us ðŸ‘‹) integrates with QuForm to give you country-level control. It filters form submissions before they reach your inbox or database, letting you stop abuse at the source.

### **What You Gain with OOPSpam**

* Country filtering to allow or block submissions.
* Language filtering to stop unwanted text.
* [Rate limiting](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) to prevent form floods.
* Machine learning-powered spam detection that blocks bots.
* Proxy, VPN, and TOR blocking for stronger protection.
* Submission logs so you know whatâ€™s being stopped.

## **How to Set It Up**

Install and activate the **OOPSpam Anti-Spam** plugin in WordPress. Create an account at **[OOPSpam.com](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login)** and get your API key.

In WordPress, go to **Settings > OOPSpam Anti-Spam** and paste in the key.

Enable spam protection for **QuForm**.

Under the **General Settings tab**, use **Country Filtering** to choose which countries to block or allow.

Save your settings and monitor results in the **Spam & Ham** [logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/).

For deeper insights, check the **OOPSpam Dashboard**, where youâ€™ll see detailed filtering reports, reasons for blocking, and spam patterns over time.

## **The Bigger Solution: Cloudflare Firewall**

If spam is just part of the problem and youâ€™re dealing with brute force logins, scraping, or DDoS attempts, youâ€™ll want a network-level solution.

[Cloudflare Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/) lets you block visitors from entire [countries](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/common-cloudflare-turnstile-errors-in-wordpress-forms-and-how-to-fix-them) before they ever reach your WordPress site.

### **Quick Setup in Cloudflare**

![Quick Setup in Cloudflare WAF](/blog/assets/posts/blocking-countries-in-cloudflare.png "Quick Setup in Cloudflare WAF")

1. [Log in](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) to **Cloudflare**.
2. Go to **Security > WAF > Firewall Rules**.
3. Create a new rule named â€˜**Block Countries**â€™.
4. Set the field to **Country**, operator **is in**, then select the countries.
5. Choose **Block** as the action and save.

From now on, traffic from those regions will never reach your forms or your site.

## **Final thoughts**

* **Use OOPSpam** â€“ When you want to block spam submissions in QuForm only.
* **Use Cloudflare** â€“ When you need site-wide blocking against traffic from entire countries.

QuForm is excellent for building powerful forms, but it isnâ€™t built for country-level security. Pairing it with [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) or Cloudflare keeps your forms open for real users while shutting out spam and abuse.
