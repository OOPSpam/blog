![Block VPN and Cloud Provider IPs in Elementor Forms](/blog/assets/posts/elementor-contact-form-design.png "Elementor forms")

Spam form submissions are often routed through VPNs or cloud servers. If you‚Äôre seeing fake leads or suspicious traffic in your [Elementor forms](https://elementor.com/pages/form-builder/), these sources could be the cause. In this guide, we‚Äôll cover why blocking them helps‚Äîand how to do it manually or with one click using the OOPSpam plugin.

## **Why Block VPN and Cloud Provider IPs in Elementor Forms?**

Spammers are clever. They often use VPNs, proxies, or servers hosted by cloud providers to submit forms anonymously. This helps them:

* Avoid being blocked by country-based or IP filters
* Rotate identities quickly
* Automate spam submissions from powerful servers

Here‚Äôs where blocking VPNs and cloud providers helps reduce form spam significantly. But there‚Äôs a bit of nuance:

* **Blocking VPNs**: This can stop spam from people using anonymizing tools like Tor or commercial VPNs. But keep in mind, legitimate users (like remote workers or privacy-conscious visitors) might also use VPNs, so enabling this should be a thoughtful decision.
* **Blocking Cloud Providers**: Most spam and bot attacks come from data centers and cloud platforms (like AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean). These IPs are rarely tied to actual users‚Äîso blocking them is a safer bet. If an IP falls under this category, it‚Äôs likely an automated program behind it, not a person.

While spam protection plugins typically check if an IP has a history of spam, blocking traffic from servers and data center IPs gives you an added layer of defense‚Äîeven against IPs that haven‚Äôt been flagged yet. This helps catch new threats early, before they hit your inbox.

You can check if a specific IP belongs to a VPN provider or data center using tools like [IP Reputation Check](https://ipreputationcheck.com/).

## **Method 1: Manually Blocking VPNs and Data Center IPs Using Cloudflare WAF**

![Manually Blocking VPNs and Data Center IPs Using Cloudflare WAF](/blog/assets/posts/cloud-based-waf-security-web-application-firewall-cloudflare.png "Cloudflare WAF")

If you‚Äôre using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for your site, you can set up rules to block traffic from VPN and data center networks manually. This approach can work, but it takes more effort to maintain.

### **How It Works**

You‚Äôll need to block traffic based on [ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (Autonomous System Numbers), which are identifiers assigned to networks like AWS, Linode, or VPN providers. These rules can help stop traffic from entire networks.

**Example**: If you notice spam traffic from DigitalOcean, you can block its ASN (AS14061) via Cloudflare‚Äôs firewall rules.

### **Limitations of Using Cloudflare WAF**

* **Manual maintenance**: ASNs and IP addresses change. You‚Äôll need to keep checking and updating them regularly.
* **Possible false positives**: Blocking by ASN may accidentally block real users, especially VPN users or businesses using cloud-hosted networks.
* **Time-consuming**: You‚Äôll need to identify which providers are responsible for the spam, research their ASNs, and apply filters yourself.

So while this method works, it‚Äôs better suited to advanced users or those managing high-traffic sites with dedicated technical resources.

## **Method 2: Block VPN and Cloud IPs with One Click Using the OOPSpam WordPress Plugin**

![OOPSpam WordPress plugin](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-overview.png "OOPSpam WordPress plugin")

If you want a faster, more automated way to filter out these IPs in Elementor forms (or any supported form plugin), our **[OOPSpam WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** (that‚Äôs us üëã) makes it easy.

We‚Äôve recently added two new toggles under IP Filtering:

* Block VPNs
* Block Cloud Providers

With one click, you can reduce spam from two major sources‚Äîwithout worrying about managing IP lists or ASN numbers.

### **What Makes This Work So Well?**

We maintain an up-to-date, industry-standard IP database that includes:

* IPs from over 2,000+ data centers
* IP ranges used by known VPN and proxy services
* Continuous updates to reflect ownership changes and newly flagged IPs

This means your Elementor forms get accurate, real-time protection without breaking a sweat.

And if you‚Äôre using [our API](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#introduction) or other integrations beyond WordPress, these same protections are available there too.

## **How to Enable VPN and Cloud IP Blocking in OOPSpam WordPress Plugin**

Setting this up takes just a few minutes. Here‚Äôs how to do it.

### **Step 1: Install or Update the Plugin**

Head to your WordPress dashboard, search for **[OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://www.oopspam.com/wordpress)** in the plugin directory, and install or update to the latest version.

![Signing up on the OOPSpam Dashboard and copy your API key.](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-dashboard-api.png " OOPSpam Dashboard")

You‚Äôll need an **API key**, which you can get by [signing up on the OOPSpam Dashboard](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login). Copy your API key and paste it into the plugin settings.

### **Step 2: Add Your API Key and Enable Elementor Spam Protection**

Go to **Settings > OOPSpam Anti-Spam** in your WordPress Admin. Under the **General** tab, select **OOPSpam Dashboard** as your source, and paste your API key into the **‚ÄúMy API Key‚Äù** field.

![Paste your API key into the ‚ÄúMy API Key‚Äù field](/blog/assets/posts/my-api-key-field.png "Add Your API Key")

If you have Elementor installed, a special section labeled **Elementor Forms** will appear below.

* Toggle on Activate Spam Protection
* Optionally, enter a custom message that appears when a submission is flagged as spam

### **Step 3: Navigate to the IP Filtering Tab**

Still in the plugin settings, click the **IP Filtering** tab. This is where you can control how the plugin handles spam based on IP origin.

![Navigate to the IP Filtering Tab.](/blog/assets/posts/ip-filtering-tab-block-vpn.png "IP Filtering Tab")

Here, you‚Äôll find two key options:

* **Block VPNs**: Prevents form submissions from known VPN or proxy IPs (use with caution)
* **Block Cloud Providers**: Blocks IPs from over 2,000 data centers and cloud platforms‚Äîthis is safer and recommended for most sites

Flip the toggles to turn them on based on your needs. Click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the page. Your Elementor forms are now protected.

No additional form changes are needed‚ÄîOOPSpam works in the background, silently filtering based on IP reputation and data source.

## **Tips for Balancing Spam Protection and User Access**

* If your audience includes global users, remote workers, or those in restricted regions, think carefully before blocking VPNs.
* Review your form submissions regularly for any false positives.
* Combine this with other filters in **[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/)** (like country or language blocking) for a layered defense.

## **Final thoughts**

Spambots aren‚Äôt going anywhere, but you don‚Äôt need to spend hours chasing IP addresses to stay ahead. Whether you‚Äôre managing a contact form, lead gen, or newsletter sign-up on Elementor, these two settings give you quick control over a major source of spam.

If you‚Äôve been overwhelmed by odd submissions from anonymous sources or server farms, try blocking VPN and cloud provider IPs using the OOPSpam plugin. It‚Äôs fast, reliable, and designed to work quietly in the background while you focus on growing your site.
