To effectively secure [MetForm](https://wpmet.com/plugin/metform/), combine its built-in anti-spam options with Cloudflare Turnstile and OOPSpamâ€™s ML spam protection + rate-limiting. This layered method blocks automated bots, human-generated spam, VPN abuse, and repeat attacks without harming legitimate users or lead flow.

Modern spam tactics can bypass basic CAPTCHAs. The following steps ensure your MetForm forms remain secure and reliable.

## **1. Enable reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha**

MetForm natively supports [reCAPTCHA](https://wpmet.com/how-to-add-recaptcha-to-your-forms-in-wordpress/) and [hCaptcha](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/adding-hcaptcha-elementorform), providing an initial challenge layer to screen automated traffic.

**Recommended configuration:**

* [reCAPTCHA v3](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3-which-is-right-for-your-website) (invisible user scoring, minimal friction)
* hCaptcha (alternative for privacy-focused sites or persistent bot traffic)

**Steps:**

![Enable reCAPTCHA](/blog/assets/posts/metform-enable-recaptcha-for-wordpress.avif "Enable reCAPTCHA")

1. WordPress Dashboard â†’ **MetForm â†’ Settings â†’ General**
2. Select **reCAPTCHA** or **hCaptcha**
3. Register your site â†’ obtain **Site Key** & **Secret Key**
4. Paste keys into MetForm settings
5. Add the CAPTCHA widget to the form

> Start with reCAPTCHA v3. Increase score threshold if suspicious traffic persists.

## **2. Add Cloudflare Turnstile**

[Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/) is a modern [CAPTCHA alternative](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/best-captcha-alternatives) that verifies user authenticity without traditional image puzzles. It uses behavioral signals and device checks, minimizing user friction.

### **Why Turnstile matters for MetForm**

### **Setup overview**

6. Enable Turnstile for forms site-wide

## **3. Limit Total Form Submissions**

[MetForm Pro](https://wpmet.com/plugin/metform/pricing/) offers a [Limit Total Entries](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-limit-form-submissions-in-metform) feature to cap form submissions. This prevents automated flood attempts and protects capacity during campaigns.

**Steps:**

1. Open the form settings
2. Enable **Limit Total Entries**
3. Define maximum submission count
4. Add a custom closure message

> Best for event forms, giveaways, lead magnets, and periods of elevated spam activity.

## **4. Implement OOPSpam for Advanced Filtering**Â 

Todayâ€™s spam campaigns bypass simple CAPTCHA. **[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/)** (thatâ€™s us ðŸ‘‹) provides intelligent screening and rate limiting, ensuring MetForm receives real submissions only.

### **Key Capabilities**

* Machine learning-powered spam scoring
* [Rate-limiting](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) by IP and email
* VPN/Proxy/TOR blocking
* Country-based filtering
* Language-based filtering
* Contextual analysis
* Works directly with MetForm

This approach provides enterprise-grade protection while preserving user experience.

### **How to Set Up OOPSpam for MetForm**

### **Enable Advanced Filters**

Turn on the following options inside OOPSpam:

* **VPN/Proxy/TOR Blocking -** Blocks anonymous networks commonly used by bots and attackers.
* **Country Rules** (allow only regions you serve) - Ensures only traffic from approved countries can submit forms.
* **Language Filter** (reject irrelevant content) - Filters submissions written in languages outside your target audience.
* **Rate Limiting -** Prevents repeated submissions from the same IP or email in a short timeframe.
* **Contextual Detection -** Analyzes [message content](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/introducing-contextual-spam-detection) and patterns to identify spam behavior.
* **Logs -** Stores [submission data](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/) so you can review blocked attempts and fine-tune rules.

These filters block modern spam vectors, including distributed bot networks and human-assisted spam activity.
