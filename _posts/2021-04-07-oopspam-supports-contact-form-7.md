✨ OOPSpam Anti-Spam WordPress plugin now supports [Contact Form 7](https://contactform7.com/).

In the [last update](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/oopspam-supports-gravity-forms), support for Gravity Forms is added along with country and language filtering.

Today, we released a new version with the following changes:

- A new setting “Current API Usage”
- Support API keys from OOPSpam Dashboard
- Contact Form 7 support
- and some bug fixes

**Current API Usage**: This allows you to see the number of remaining spam checks and the current limit according to your plan.

**Support API keys from OOPSpam Dashboard**: As you may know, an API key for the plugin could only be generated on the RapidAPI marketplace. A few weeks ago, we launched OOPSpam Dashboard which requires no credit card to get started. It's also possible to generate an API key and test the API without doing any integration. This update brings support for the API keys generated through OOPSpam Dashboard.

**Contact Form 7 support**: The popular and perhaps most used contact form plugin with 5M installs. Our plugin integrates both with Contact Form 7 and Flamingo.

> By default Contact Form 7 doesn't store form submission and simply forward them to your email. Flamingo is a plugin by the same author to store form submissions.

That's all for now.

Happy spam-free day!
