Spam submissions waste time, flood inboxes, and slow websites. The best way to protect your [Avada Forms](https://avada.com/feature/form-builder/) is to use the built-in Honeypot, reCAPTCHA, or Cloudflare Turnstile elements,  then layer an advanced external filter like [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) for advanced protection.

Each method below builds upon the last, combining front-end and back-end defense to stop both basic bots and smarter human-assisted spam.

## **1. Add a Honeypot Field Element**

![Add a Honeypot Field Element](/blog/assets/posts/honeypot-field-element.png "Honeypot Field Element")

The Avada [Honeypot Field Element](https://avada.com/documentation/honeypot-field-element/) adds a hidden field to your form that bots can see but humans can’t. When a bot fills it out, Avada automatically rejects the submission.

**How to set it up:**

* Go to **Avada Form Builder → Add Element → Honeypot**.
* Add it to your form. No configuration needed.
* Avada will automatically block any form that fills this hidden field.

Use one [Honeypot](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/ways-to-stop-spam#honeypot-filter-spam-with-a-hidden-field:~:text=Final%20thoughts-,Honeypot%3A%20filter%20spam%20with%20a%20hidden%20field,-It%20is%20the) per form. It’s lightweight, fast, and doesn’t impact your visitors’ experience.

## **2. Enable reCAPTCHA Field Element**

![Enable reCAPTCHA Field Element](/blog/assets/posts/avada_recaptcha.png "reCAPTCHA ")

The Avada [reCAPTCHA Field](https://avada.com/documentation/recaptcha-field-element/) integrates Google’s verification service, adding a quick human check to your forms. It works with [reCAPTCHA v2](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3-which-is-right-for-your-website) (the “I’m not a robot” box) or v3 (silent score-based filtering).

**Setup steps:**

* In WordPress, go to **Avada Dashboard → Options → Forms → Google reCAPTCHA**.
* Add your **Site Key** and **Secret Key** from your Google [reCAPTCHA](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/best-recaptcha-alternatives) account.
* In your form, click **Add Element → reCAPTCHA Field**.
* Choose between **v2** or **v3**, then adjust settings like badge position or color scheme.

Use v3 for smoother UX and v2 for high-risk forms (like quote or contact requests). If your submit button disappears, exclude reCAPTCHA scripts from JS minification in your cache plugin.

## **3. Strengthen Protection with OOPSpam** 

Even with [CAPTCHA](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/best-captcha-alternatives) tools, human-assisted and machine learning-driven spam can slip through. That’s where **[OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** comes in.

OOPSpam blocks spam before it reaches your inbox by analyzing content, IP reputation, and submission patterns using machine learning. It protects all your forms, including Avada Forms.

**How to set it up:**

Install and activate **OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin** from your WordPress dashboard. **[Create an account](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login)** and get your **API key**.

![Strengthen Protection with OOPSpam](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-dashboard-api.png "OOPSpam ")

Go to **WordPress → OOPSpam → General Settings** and **paste your API key**.

**Activate spam protection** for Avada Forms.

Enable extra protections under these tabs:

* **Rate Limiting:** Stop [repeated submissions](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam).
* **IP Filtering:** Block known spam IPs or countries.
* **Contextual Detection:** Catch hidden text or obfuscated spam.
* **Logs:** View blocked entries and reasons for transparency.

**Why OOPSpam is worth adding:**

* Blocks spam from bots, VPNs, and proxy traffic.
* Uses machine learning to analyze message content, not just user behavior.
* Filters by language or country for region-specific forms.
* Works silently in the background,  no extra challenge for real users.
* Keeps detailed [logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/) so you can see what was blocked and why.

> **Pro Tip:** Start with moderate sensitivity, review your logs after one week, then fine-tune.

This combination, Avada’s built-in spam protection plus OOPSpam, stops almost all automated and human-assisted spam attacks.

## **4. Use Cloudflare Turnstile Field Element**

![Use Cloudflare Turnstile Field Element](/blog/assets/posts/avada-turnstile.png "Cloudflare Turnstile")

The Avada [Turnstile Field](https://avada.com/element/turnstile-field/) verifies human visitors without puzzles or images. It’s fast, lightweight, and doesn’t rely on tracking cookies.

**How to set it up:**

1. Log in to **Cloudflare** → **Turnstile** → click **Add Widget**.
2. Add your website domain and copy the **Site Key** and **Secret Key**.
3. In Avada, go to **Options → Forms → Cloudflare Turnstile** → paste both keys.
4. Add the **Turnstile Field Element** to your form.
5. Choose your display mode — “Always” or “Interaction Only.”

Turnstile improves UX, avoids Google dependencies, and works seamlessly with Avada. It’s ideal if you want invisible spam protection that doesn’t frustrate real users.

### **Bonus Tips to Keep Forms Clean**

* Don’t stack multiple CAPTCHA systems. Use only one per form.
* Always test forms in an Incognito browser after setup.
* Exclude CAPTCHA or Turnstile scripts from JS minify/defer in cache plugins.
* Review blocked logs weekly to adjust sensitivity and catch edge cases.
* Add rate-limit rules in OOPSpam or [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) for high-traffic and public forms.

## **Final Takeaway**

The most reliable way to protect Avada Forms from spam is to layer protection: Use Honeypot for invisible defense, Turnstile or reCAPTCHA for real-user verification, and OOPSpam for advanced, machine learning-powered filtering.

Together, these tools keep your website clean, your inbox manageable, and your users’ experience smooth, without compromising on speed or privacy.
