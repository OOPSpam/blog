If you use Zapier to automate form submissions, youâ€™ve likely seen off-topic or irrelevant messages get throughâ€”even when using traditional spam filters. Thatâ€™s often because many form builders used with Zapier donâ€™t pass the submitterâ€™s IP address.

To solve this, you can use contextual spam detection. This guide shows you how to use [OOPSpamâ€™s Context-Aware Spam Detection](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/introducing-contextual-spam-detection) to block messages that donâ€™t match the purpose of your form or website.

## **What Is Contextual Spam Detection?**

![Contextual Spam Detection](/blog/assets/posts/screenshot-2025-05-12-at-11001_erl7oi.png "Contextual Spam Detection")

Unlike traditional spam filters that rely on IPs, email reputation, or blacklists, contextual detection evaluates whether the message content is relevant to your website or business.

For example, if someone submits a message about "crypto investment opportunities" on your photography contact form, itâ€™s clearly off-topic. OOPSpamâ€™s contextual detection flags it based on semantic mismatch between the form content and your defined context.

This is especially useful when:

* The only data available is the message (no IP or sender metadata).
* Email looks legitimate but the content isnâ€™t.
* You use tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), where personal data isnâ€™t passed through for privacy reasons.

> âš¡ Contextual Spam Detection doesnâ€™t replace traditional methodsâ€”it complements them. Itâ€™s an alternative when you canâ€™t rely on email/IP filters alone.

Another common use case is in [Zapier](https://community.zapier.com/show-tell-5/how-to-stop-spam-in-your-zap-with-oopspam-46293), [Make](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/5-common-spam-problems-in-make-how-to-fix-them), or other automation tools that don't pass along the form submitter's IP address. In those cases, content and context alone offer a much stronger way to determine whether a message belongs.

## **How to Use Contextual Spam Detection in Zapier**

Letâ€™s walk through the setup using a Zap that handles form submissions from Jotform.

### **Step 1: Start With Your Form Trigger**

Begin your Zap with a form trigger. In this example, weâ€™ll use [Jotform](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/stop-spam-on-jotform-using-zapier-and-oopspam).

![Start With Your Form Trigger](/blog/assets/posts/jotform-start-with-your-form-trigger.png "Start With Your Form Trigger")

**Trigger:** `New Submission in Jotform`

### **Step 2: Add the OOPSpam Step**

Add an action step to your Zap and search for **OOPSpam** (thatâ€™s us! ðŸ‘‹).

![Add the OOPSpam Step and focus on the Context setting ](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-context-setting.png "Add the OOPSpam Step")

**Action:** `Check for Spam`

Youâ€™ll see a configuration screen where you can map in your form fields.

Focus on the **Context** setting here. This is where you define what your website is about so OOPSpam can detect whether the message fits or not.

Just fill in:

* **Content**: The message submitted
* **Context**: A sentence about the websiteâ€™s purposeÂ 

There are other advanced options tooâ€”like [blocking VPNs](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-block-ips-from-vpn-and-cloud-providers-in-zapier), limiting by [country](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/blocking-countries-from-accessing-your-website-using-cloudflare), or choosing allowed [languages](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-automatically-block-spam-form-submissions-in-zapier-based-on-language)â€”but for contextual detection, the key thing is to make sure your Content and Context fields are mapped.

> **Note:** When Context is provided, IP or email-based spam detection won't work. The detection relies fully on the content-to-context match.

### **Step 3: Define Your Context**

This is the most important part of using contextual spam detection effectively.

![Define Your Context](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-context-field.png "Define Your Context")

In the **Context** field, briefly describe your websiteâ€™s purpose or business is intended for (2-3 sentences max). Think of this as the reference point OOPSpam will use to determine whether the message makes sense.

Examples include:

* "We sell handmade leather goods through our Shopify store."
* "Our website offers wedding photography services across the UK."
* "We provide customer support and feedback management tools for e-commerce businesses."

The more accurate and specific your context is, the better the detection will work at filtering out irrelevant or misleading submissions.

### **Step 4: Add Filter by Zapier (Optional)**

Once OOPSpam returns a result, you can add a **Filter** step in Zapier to only continue the workflow if the message meets your spam score threshold.

In this case, weâ€™ll filter based on the spam score returned by OOPSpam.

![Add Filter by Zapier based on the spam score returned by OOPSpam](/blog/assets/posts/zapier-filter-condition-setup.png "Add Filter by Zapier")

**Filter condition:** `Spam Score` is less than 3

In general, scores below 3 are typically not spam. Anything 3 and above is more likely to be spam, so this filter keeps your workflow clean.

### **Step 5: Proceed With Your Workflow**

Now that you've filtered out irrelevant content, continue your workflow:

* Send notifications
* Add data to your CRM
* Trigger auto-replies

Only messages that align with your defined context will make it through. Everything else gets quietly blocked.
