### **Can HappyForms Block Countries on Its Own?**

No. [HappyForms](https://happyforms.io/) is designed for building user-friendly forms and managing submissions, not filtering traffic by geography. If spam or abuse comes from certain countries, youâ€™ll need additional tools like [OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) or Cloudflare.

## **Block Spam Submissions by Country using OOPSpam**

The fastest way to add country-level blocking to HappyForms is with the [OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) (thatâ€™s us ðŸ‘‹). It works silently in the background, preventing unwanted entries before theyâ€™re delivered to you.

### **What OOPSpam Can Do**

* Block or allow submissions by country.
* Filter text by language to reduce irrelevant entries.
* [Limit](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/how-to-limit-form-submissions-in-happyforms) abuse with [frequency](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) controls.
* Detect bots with machine learning-powered spam checks.
* Block VPN, proxy, and TOR traffic for stronger protection.
* Log every submission so you know what was blocked and why.

## **How to Enable Country Filtering in HappyForms**

Install and activate the **OOPSpam Anti-Spam** plugin. Create an account at **[OOPSpam.com](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login)** and generate your API key.

In WordPress, go to **Settings > OOPSpam Anti-Spam** and paste the key.

Enable spam protection for **HappyForms**.

Use **Country Filtering** under the **General Settings** tab in OOPSpam to select which countries to block or allow.

Save and review results in the **Spam & Ham** [logs](https://help.oopspam.com/wordpress/form-entries/) inside WordPress.

You can also check the **OOPSpam Dashboard**, which shows filtering reports, reasons for blocking, and submission patterns over time.

With this setup, only legitimate submissions from approved regions will make it through.

## **Block Entire Countries from Your Website with Cloudflare**

If spam isnâ€™t your only concern and youâ€™re also dealing with brute force logins, scraping, or DDoS attacks, use [Cloudflare Firewall Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/). This blocks visitors from [entire countries](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/common-cloudflare-turnstile-errors-in-wordpress-forms-and-how-to-fix-them) before they even reach your site.

### **Cloudflare Setup in 5 Steps**

![Block Entire Countries from Your Website with Cloudflare](/blog/assets/posts/blocking-countries-in-cloudflare.png "Cloudflare WAF")

1. [Log in](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) to **Cloudflare**.
2. Go to **Security > WAF > Firewall Rules**.
3. Create a new rule called â€˜**Block Countries**â€™.
4. Set the field to **Country**, operator **is in**, then select the countries to block.
5. Choose **Block** as the action and save.

From then on, traffic from those countries wonâ€™t reach your forms or any part of your site.

## **Final Takeaway**

* **OOPSpam** â€“ Best if you want [form-level filtering in HappyForms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/5-ways-to-protect-your-happyforms-from-spam) while keeping your site accessible.
* **Cloudflare** â€“ Best if you need site-wide blocking against unwanted or abusive traffic.

HappyForms is great for building forms but isnâ€™t designed for security. Pair it with OOPSpam and Cloudflare for complete spam protection. Together, they keep your forms open to genuine users while blocking spam and abuse at multiple levels.
