Keeping WordPress secure means constantly tracking updates across core, plugins, and themes. It's easy to miss something critical. OOPVulns is a vulnerability scanner that monitors your WordPress installation and alerts you to security threats, so you can stay protected with minimal effort.

## What is OOPVulns?

OOPVulns automatically scans your WordPress installation and checks every component against a constantly updated database of known security threats:

* **WordPress Core** - Alerts you to outdated or vulnerable WordPress versions
* **Plugins** - Identifies security issues in your active and inactive plugins
* **Themes** - Finds vulnerabilities in the themes running on your site
