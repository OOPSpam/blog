If you're seeing fake leads or strange submissions in your [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/), chances are they're coming from VPNs or cloud-based servers. These sources are popular among spambots for staying anonymous. This guide shows you how to block themâ€”either manually or instantly with the OOPSpam plugin.

## **Why Block VPN and Cloud Provider IPs in Gravity Forms?**

Spammers often use VPNs, proxies, and cloud hosting providers to avoid detection. These tactics allow them to:

* Bypass country or IP-based filters
* Automate spam attacks at scale
* Conceal their real identity

By blocking VPN and data center IPs, you can significantly reduce Gravity Forms spam without relying solely on traditional spam filters.

* **VPN Blocking:** This helps block traffic from anonymizing tools like Tor or paid VPN services. Just note that some real usersâ€”remote workers or privacy-conscious individualsâ€”may use VPNs too.
* **Cloud IP Blocking:** This is the more effective and safer route. Most bot traffic originates from platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and DigitalOcean. These IPs are rarely used by everyday users.

Unlike filters that rely on previous spam activity, blocking IPs from VPNs and data centers stops spam *before* it happensâ€”even if the IP has never been flagged before.

Want to verify if an IP is from a VPN or data center? Use a tool like [IP Reputation Check](https://ipreputationcheck.com/) to confirm.

## **Method 1: Manually Block VPNs and Cloud IPs via Cloudflare**

![Manually Block VPNs and Cloud IPs via Cloudflare](/blog/assets/posts/cloud-based-waf-security-web-application-firewall-cloudflare.png "Cloudflare WAF")

If your website runs through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can create firewall rules to block spammy networks.

### **How It Works**

Use [ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (Autonomous System Numbers) to block traffic from entire networks. For example, if you're seeing spam from DigitalOcean, block ASN AS14061 in Cloudflare.

### **Limitations of Using Cloudflare WAF**

* **Manual upkeep:** ASN lists can change frequently, so you'll need to stay on top of updates.
* **False positives:** Legit users on VPNs or business cloud networks may be affected.
* **Time-consuming:** Youâ€™ll have to research which networks are responsible for the spam and apply the rules yourself.

Unless you have a tech team, this method can be a hassle. Thatâ€™s why a plugin solution is often a better choice.

## **Method 2: Block VPN and Cloud IPs in Gravity Forms Using the OOPSpam WordPress Plugin**

![OOPSpam WordPress plugin](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-anti-spam-overview.png "OOPSpam WordPress plugin")

If you want a simple, automated way to filter VPN and cloud IPs from your Gravity Forms, the **[OOPSpam WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)** (thatâ€™s us ðŸ‘‹) makes it super easy.

Weâ€™ve built in two toggles under IP Filtering:

* Block VPNs
* Block Cloud Providers

These options work with Gravity Forms and block spam at the sourceâ€”without you needing to manage IPs or firewall settings.

### **Why OOPSpam Works So Well**

Our plugin uses a constantly updated database that includes:

* IPs from over 2,000+ cloud data centers
* VPN and proxy service IPs
* Real-time updates and reputation tracking

That means your [Gravity Forms spam protection](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-gravity-forms) is always up-to-date and highly accurate. These features also work across other platforms if you're using [OOPSpam API](https://www.oopspam.com/docs/#introduction) integrations or other form plugins.

## **How to Enable VPN and Cloud Blocking in Gravity Forms (Using OOPSpam)**

Hereâ€™s how to set it up in minutes:

### **Step 1: Install or Update the OOPSpam Plugin**

![Sign up at the OOPSpam Dashboard to get your API key. ](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-dashboard-api.png "OOPSpam dashboard")

Go to your WordPress dashboard, search for **OOPSpam Anti-Spam**, and install the latest version. [Sign up at the OOPSpam Dashboard](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Login) to get your API key. Paste this into the plugin settings.

### **Step 2: Add API Key & Activate Gravity Forms Spam Protection**

![Add API Key & Activate Gravity Forms Spam Protection](/blog/assets/posts/my-api-key-field.png "Add API Key ")

Go to **Settings > OOPSpam Anti-Spam** in your WordPress Admin. Under the **General** tab:

* Choose *OOPSpam Dashboard* as your source

### **Step 3: Enable IP Filtering**

Click on the **IP Filtering** tab in the plugin settings.

There, youâ€™ll find two main options:

* **Block VPNs:** Stops form submissions from known VPN or proxy IPs (use cautiously)
* **Block Cloud Providers:** Blocks IPs from major cloud platformsâ€”this is the recommended setting for most users

Toggle on what fits your needs and hit **Save Changes**. Youâ€™re doneâ€”no extra form setup required. OOPSpam now works quietly in the background to block unwanted traffic from hitting your Gravity Forms.

## **Best Practices for Gravity Forms Spam Protection**

* Be careful with VPN blocking if your audience includes remote teams or privacy-focused users
* Regularly review flagged submissions to avoid false positives
* Use additional **[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/)** features like language detection and country blocking for a layered defense
