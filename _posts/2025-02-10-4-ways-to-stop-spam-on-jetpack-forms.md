Spam submissions are one of the biggest frustrations for website owners using Jetpack Forms. If you've noticed an influx of spammy contact form submissions, fake user registrations, or irrelevant messages flooding your inbox, you're not alone.

While [Jetpack Forms](https://jetpack.com/forms/) is a solid form builder that comes bundled with the Jetpack plugin, its built-in spam protection is limited. Out of the box, it only supports Akismet, which, while helpful, isnâ€™t always enough to filter out sophisticated spam attacks. If you want to stop spam on Jetpack Forms effectively, you'll need additional tools like OOPSpam, reCAPTCHA, or hCaptcha to reinforce your defenses.

In this guide, weâ€™ll explore four highly effective ways to stop spam on Jetpack Forms, starting with OOPSpamâ€”the best AI-powered spam filtering solution.

## **1. Implement OOPSpam for Advanced Protection**

One of the biggest challenges in stopping spam is dealing with both automated bots and human spammers. CAPTCHA-based solutions like reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha can help against bots, but they donâ€™t stop manual spam and can sometimes hurt user experience.

Thatâ€™s where OOPSpam comes in. Unlike CAPTCHA solutions, OOPSpam uses machine learning spam filtering that works in the background without disrupting your users.

### **How OOPSpam Works with Jetpack Forms**

[OOPSpam](https://www.oopspam.com/) (thatâ€™s us! ðŸ‘‹) is a server-side spam filtering tool, meaning it does not rely on browser-side scripts that slow down your site. Instead, it scans form submissions using a combination of:

* **Machine Learning Analysis** â€“ Utilizes advanced algorithms to assess message content and identify spam patterns.
* **Extensive Database** â€“ Cross-references submissions with a comprehensive list of known spam IPs and emails.
* **Customizable Sensitivity** â€“ Allows users to adjust the spam filtering sensitivity to suit their specific needs.
* **Geographical and Language Restrictions** â€“ Enables blocking or allowing submissions based on country or language.
* **Manual Moderation** â€“ Provides options to manually block specific emails, IPs, or keywords.
* **Rate Limiting** â€“ Controls [submission rates](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/protecting-forms-with-rate-limiting-in-wordpress-using-oopspam) to prevent abuse and click frauds, ensuring that spam bots cannot overwhelm your forms with multiple rapid submissions.

This makes OOPSpam an effective [alternative to reCAPTCHA](https://www.oopspam.com/recaptcha-alternative) and other spam-blocking solutions. It does not require user interaction, making it ideal for improving form accessibility and user experience.

### **How to Set Up OOPSpam on Jetpack Forms**

To integrate OOPSpam with Jetpack Forms, follow these steps:

#### **1. Get an OOPSpam API Key**

![OOPSpam dashboard displaying API usage, average response time, and API key.](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-dashboard-.png "OOPSpam Dashboard Overview")

1. **Visit** OOPSpam.com and **[sign up](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Register)** for an account.
2. Once registered, **copy your API key** from the OOPSpam dashboard.

#### **2. Install and Activate the OOPSpam Plugin**

1. Log in to your **WordPress dashboard**.
2. Go to **Plugins > Add New**.
3. Search for **[OOPSpam Anti-Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/)**.
4. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.

#### **3. Configure OOPSpam Settings for Jetpack Forms**

![OOPSpam General Settings page showing API key input and sensitivity level adjustment.](/blog/assets/posts/oopspam-general-settings-page.png "OOPSpam General Settings Configuration")

1. In WordPress, go to **Settings > OOPSpam Anti-Spam**.
2. Paste your **API key** into the designated field.
3. Set the spam detection sensitivity to **Moderate** (the recommended setting). This level provides a balanced approach, effectively blocking spam without risking legitimate submissions.
4. Enable **Rate Limiting** to **prevent abuse and click fraud**:

![Rate limiting settings configuration in OOPSpam.](/blog/assets/posts/rate-limiting-settings.png "OOPSpam Rate Limiting Settings")

* Restrict how frequently the same **email** and **IP address** can submit forms.
* Block spam bots that attempt rapid form submissions.

5. Under the **Manual Moderation** tab, you can configure additional options:

![Manual moderation settings screen showing blocked emails, IPs, and keywords with options to allow specific entries.](/blog/assets/posts/manual-moderation.png "Manual Moderation Settings Configuration")

* Block specific **IPs, email addresses, and keywords**.

#### **4. Enable OOPSpam Spam Protection for Jetpack Forms**

![Jetpack Form settings with spam protection activated and custom spam message input.](/blog/assets/posts/jetpack-form-spam-protection.png "Jetpack Form Spam Protection Settings")

1. Still in **OOPSpam Anti-Spam settings**, scroll to supported plugins.
2. Look for **Jetpack Forms** in the list of supported plugins.
3. Toggle the **Activate Spam Protection** switch to the **ON** position.

âœ… Once activated, OOPSpam will start blocking spam immediatelyâ€”without slowing down your site or requiring user interaction.

### **Why Choose OOPSpam Over Other Spam Solutions?**

* **Blocks both bots and manual spam** (unlike CAPTCHA solutions).
* **No impact on website speed** (works server-side).
* **Customizable filtering options** (block specific keywords, emails, and IPs).
* **Country and language restrictions** (only accept form submissions from certain locations).
* **No user friction** (visitors donâ€™t have to solve a CAPTCHA).

If youâ€™re looking for a hassle-free, highly effective way to stop spam on Jetpack Forms, OOPSpam is the best choice.

## **2. Enable Akismet for Spam Protection**

![Akismet banner with the slogan "Spam shall not pass."](/blog/assets/posts/banner-1544x500.png "Akismet Spam Protection Banner")

If youâ€™ve been using Jetpack Forms, you may have noticed an option for Akismet Anti-Spam. Akismet is included by default with Jetpack.

### **How Akismet Works**

* Akismet scans each form submission and compares it against its global spam database.
* If a submission matches known spam patterns, it gets flagged as spam and wonâ€™t appear in your inbox.
* Itâ€™s easy to set up and requires minimal configuration.

### **How to Enable Akismet on Jetpack Forms**

1. Install and activate the **Akismet Anti-Spam plugin** (if not already active).
2. Sign up for an **Akismet API key** at akismet.com.
3. Enter your **API key** in the Akismet settings panel.
4. Jetpack Forms will now automatically filter spam submissions.

### **Limitations of Akismet**

While Akismet is useful, itâ€™s not perfect:

* Does not block manual spam (it only works against bots).
* Not 100% reliable against advanced spam bots.

For [better spam protection](https://www.oopspam.com/akismet-alternative), OOPSpam offers a more feature-rich solution [compared to Akismet](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/oopspam-vs-akismet-why-users-switch-to-oopspam).

## **3. Add Google reCAPTCHA to Jetpack Forms**

Unlike other popular form builders like [WPForms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-wpforms), [Fluent Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-fluent-forms), and [Elementor Forms](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/spam-protection-for-elementor-forms), Jetpack Forms does not have built-in reCAPTCHA support. If you want to use reCAPTCHA, youâ€™ll need to install a third-party plugin called reCAPTCHA Jetpack.

### **How to Enable reCAPTCHA on Jetpack Forms**

![Jetpack reCAPTCHA settings with fields for site key, secret key, and reCAPTCHA type selection.](/blog/assets/posts/jetpack-recaptcha-settings.png "Jetpack reCAPTCHA Configuration Settings")

1. Install and activate the [reCAPTCHA Jetpack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recaptcha-jetpack/) from the WordPress Plugin Directory.
2. Sign up for **[Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create)** and obtain your **Site Key & Secret Key**.
3. Enter the **keys in the plugin settings**.
4. Select **reCAPTCHA v2 (challenge-based) or v3 (score-based)**.

### **Limitations of reCAPTCHA**

* Can [slow down your website](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/recaptcha-performance-analyses) (loads additional JavaScript files).
* Privacy concerns (tracks user behavior).
* Not always user-friendly (CAPTCHA challenges can frustrate visitors).

If speed and user experience are priorities, OOPSpam is a better alternative to reCAPTCHA.

## **4. Add hCaptcha for Privacy-Focused Spam Protection**

If you want an alternative to Google reCAPTCHA that prioritizes privacy, you can use hCaptcha instead. However, Jetpack Forms does not support hCaptcha natively, so youâ€™ll need to install the [hCaptcha for WP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hcaptcha-for-forms-and-more/) plugin.

### **How to Enable hCaptcha on Jetpack Forms**

![hCaptcha integration settings showing Jetpack Contact Form toggle.](/blog/assets/posts/hcaptcha-integration-with-jetpack.png "hCaptcha Integration with Jetpack Contact Form")

1. Install and activate the **hCaptcha for WP plugin**.
2. Sign up on **[hCaptcha.com](http://hcaptcha.com)** to generate an **API key**.
3. Enter the **API key in the plugin settings**.
4. Enable **hCaptcha for Jetpack Forms**.

### **Limitations of hCaptcha**

* Requires users to solve [image-based puzzles](https://www.oopspam.com/blog/hcaptcha-performance-analyses) (can impact conversions).
* No invisible version available (unlike Google reCAPTCHA v3).

While hCaptcha is a privacy-friendly alternative to reCAPTCHA, it offers significant advantages in terms of privacy. Unlike reCAPTCHA, which tracks user behavior, hCaptcha ensures that user data is not collected or shared, making it a better choice for those prioritizing data privacy.

## **Final Thoughts**

Jetpack Forms is a great tool, but it needs additional spam protection to keep your forms clean and secure.

Hereâ€™s a quick recap of the best ways to stop spam on Jetpack Forms:

* **OOPSpam** â€“ machine-learning filtering, no CAPTCHAs, blocks bots and manual spam.
* **Akismet** â€“ Basic bot filtering (but limited against advanced spam).
* **Google reCAPTCHA** â€“ Good bot protection, but can slow your site.
* **hCaptcha** â€“ Privacy-friendly CAPTCHA alternative, but requires user interaction.

For the best balance of security, speed, and user experience, OOPSpam is the top recommendation. If you have any questions or need extra guidance, [OOPSpamâ€™s support team](https://www.oopspam.com/#contact) is always here to help.
