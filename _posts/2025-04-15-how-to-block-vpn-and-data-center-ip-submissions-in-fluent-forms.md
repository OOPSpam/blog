Getting bombarded with spam through your Fluent Forms? A common source of these annoying, fake submissions is traffic coming from VPNs and cloud data centers. These IPs are often used by bots to bypass filters and flood your inbox with junk. In this guide, we‚Äôll show you how to block those submissions manually through Cloudflare or automatically using the OOPSpam plugin for WordPress.

## **Why Block VPN and Cloud IPs in Fluent Forms?**

[Fluent Forms](https://fluentforms.com/) is a flexible WordPress form builder‚Äîbut even with its built-in protections, spam can still sneak through. Spambots are becoming more sophisticated, often using:

* VPN services to hide their location and identity
* Proxies to bypass IP-based rules
* Cloud servers (like AWS or Google Cloud) to submit high volumes of automated spam

Blocking these IP sources gives you a smarter defense, especially when dealing with unknown or unflagged threats.

### **Blocking VPNs**

When you block VPN IPs, you stop submissions from people trying to hide their identities‚Äîlike those using Tor or commercial VPN tools. However, some legitimate users (remote workers or users in restricted regions) might also use VPNs, so it‚Äôs a setting you‚Äôll want to enable carefully depending on your audience.

### **Blocking Cloud Providers**

This is usually the safer route. The majority of spam bots operate from cloud-hosted servers, not personal devices. Blocking data center IPs (from services like DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, Linode, etc.) drastically cuts down automated form submissions. These IPs are typically not tied to genuine users, making it a low-risk, high-impact solution.

Traditional spam filters only catch repeat offenders. Blocking by IP origin‚Äîespecially from VPNs and cloud networks‚Äîadds an extra layer of protection, catching new and unreported threats early.

> Want to verify where a suspicious IP is from? Tools like **[IP Reputation Check](https://ipreputationcheck.com/)** can tell you if it belongs to a data center or VPN.

## **Method 1: Block VPN and Cloud Traffic with Cloudflare Firewall**

If your WordPress site uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can create firewall rules to block traffic from known VPNs and cloud providers.

### **How to Do It**

You‚Äôll need to block by [ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) (Autonomous System Numbers), which represent networks like Amazon AWS, Hetzner, and various VPN services.

**Example:** If you see frequent spam from DigitalOcean, block **ASN AS14061** using Cloudflare‚Äôs dashboard.

### **Drawbacks**

While this method is effective, it‚Äôs also:

* **Manual:** ASNs and IP ranges change frequently. You'll have to monitor and update regularly.
* **Risky:** You could block real users, especially those on shared networks or using VPNs.
* **Time-intensive:** You‚Äôll need to research providers, identify their ASNs, and maintain rule lists.

This method is best for developers or businesses with technical resources and high-traffic sites.

## **Method 2: Block VPN and Cloud IPs in Fluent Forms with OOPSpam (One-Click Solution)**
